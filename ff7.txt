     Ah, too bad I'm not a better ASCII artist. Welcome to the Final 
Fantasy VII Script.

     The way I transcribed the different choices ("I don't care / OK, let's 
go," and the like) requires a little bit of explanation:


<CHOICE>
	Do this
	Do that

***Lead character
	Do this

(Here's all the stuff that happens when you do this)

***Lead character
      Do that

(Here's all the stuff that happens when you do that)

<//>

(Here's all the stuff that happens no matter whether you do this or that)


The actual choices are somewhat more interesting.

     If you discover any grammatical errors, misspellings, or typos, or if 
you have a question, comment, or suggestion about the script, I much 
appreciate it if you email me about it so I can try to incorporate it 
into the next versions.

     An enhanced version of this script with HTML formatting, music, and 
screenshots of the entire game is available at my website at

transcribing it. Sit back, plant your finger squarely on that down-arrow

Scene 1
- Presentiment - AVALANCHE -

(Introduction FMV. The camera pans slowly across a starfield for 
several seconds before we see a beautiful young woman looking directly 
at us. Green embers waft upwards around her face. The camera moves to show 
that the embers are generated by a Mako furnace in a dark alley as the 
woman stares into it. After a few moments, she turns and leaves the alley, 
a basket of flowers on one arm, and stops to stand at a street corner. 
Our view of her is momentarily obstructed by a massive train as it
speeds past through the town square. The camera swings outward through 
the dark, dingy square, under a stone arch, and then begins to swing 
upwards. The view moves higher and higher until the entire circular city 
of Midgar comes into view. The Final Fantasy VII logo appears for a few 
moments before the camera begins to swing back down, into a different part 
of a city. A train is pulling into a station in another dark alley. Two 
guards patrol the platform. Jessie flips spectacularly off the train. The
guards attack the intruder only to be knocked out by her skillful hands 
and feet. Barret hops out of the train, turns, and motions for another 
to follow.) 

Barret 
        "C'mon newcomer. Follow me." 

(He runs upstairs. Cloud flips out of the train and follows
him. Two guards come down the stairs down to the train
platform, blocking his path.) 

(Battle sequence with two guards) 

(After the battle, Cloud runs up the stairs and meets the
group - Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge, opening the main gate
to a Mako reactor.) 

Biggs 
         "Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! ...Not
everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE." 

Jessie 
         "SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?" 
         "What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?" 

Biggs 
         "Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER." 
         "He quit them and now is one of us." 
         "Didn't catch your name..." 

(The PLAYER names Cloud) 

Cloud 
         "...Cloud." 

Biggs 
         "Cloud, eh? I'm..." 

Cloud 
        "I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over... I'm 
outta here." 

(Barret comes running up from offscreen.) 

Barret 
         "The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a 
group!" 
         "Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge 
in front of it." 

(The group heads through the gate. Barret stops and turns to face Cloud.) 

         "Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!" 

(The PLAYER names Barret) 

Barret 
         "If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL] 
button to run. (earlier marked X)" 

(FMV sequence. The camera swings to show the Shinra headquarters towering 
above as Cloud following Barret through the
gate. Cloud follows the others to the Reactor. Wedge stays on the bridge 
in front of the reactor as the others head inside.) 

Wedge 
         "I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the
mission, Cloud." 
         "Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace
up? This'll be somethin' to see!" 

(Cloud follows the others into the Reactor.) 

Barret 
         "Yo! This your first time in a reactor?" 

Cloud 
         "No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know." 

Barret 
         "The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it
every day." 
         "It's the life blood of the planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the 
blood out with these machines." 

Cloud 
         "I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry." 

Barret 
         "That's it! You're comin' with me from now on." 

(Barret joins Cloud. The group works through the locked doors deeper 
inside the reactor.) 

Jessie 
         "Biggs and I got the code for this door." 

Biggs 
         "Code deciphered" 

(They go through the door.) 

Biggs 
         "Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this 
code..." 

Jessie 
         "Code deciphered" 

(They go through the door and work deeper into the reactor. Biggs stays at 
the door. They enter an elevator) 

Jessie 
         "Push that button over there!" 

(Cloud presses the button. The elevator starts moving.) 

Barret 
         "Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And 
that'll be that." 

Cloud 
         "It's not my problem." 

Barret 
         "The planet's dyin', Cloud!" 

Cloud 
         "The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before 
security and the Roboguards come." 

(Barret turns away, shaking with anger, then looks back over his shoulder 
at Cloud and rejoins him. The elevator stops and
Jessie gets off. They continue into the reactor.) 

Jessie 
         "Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it.
After that, use the [Directional button] to move up and down." 

(Jessie stays behind. Cloud continues to the reactor core.) 

Barret 
         "When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more
than a hunka junk." 
         "Cloud, you set the bomb." 

Cloud 
         "Shouldn't you do it?" 

Barret 
         "Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'." 

Cloud 
         "Fine, be my guest." 

(As Cloud moves to set the bomb, the screen dims and something speaks into 
his mind.) 

         Watch out! 
         This isn't just a reactor!! 

(It stops abruptly.) 

Barret 
         "...What's wrong?" 

Cloud 
         "Huh?" 

Barret 
         "What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, sorry." 

(Cloud sets the bomb. An alarm begins to sound and red lights
flash.) 

Barret 
         "Heads up, here they come!" 

(Boss battle with Guard Scorpion) 

Cloud 
         "Come on, let's get outta here!" 

         Ten minutes to detonation! 

(They rush back out through the reactor until they meet up with Jessie 
where she had stayed behind. She has one leg caught in the grate she's 
standing on.) 

Cloud 
         "You all right?" 

Jessie 
         "My leg got stuck." 

(Cloud pulls her out.) 

         "Thanks!" 

(They continue to hurry out of the reactor.) 

Biggs 
         "Let's go!" 

Jessie 
         "Code deciphered" 

(They go through the door.) 

Jessie 
         "Alright, be careful." 

Biggs 
        "Code deciphered" 

(They go through the door and exit the reactor. On the way out, Jessie 
falls. Cloud helps her up and they sprint away. FMV sequence. The reactor 
emits a ring of fire as it explodes spectacularly against the night sky.) 



  
  



Scene 2
- Escape From Mako Reactor 7 -

(Cloud, Barret, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are in a dark tunnel littered 
with debris and broken metal.) 

Biggs 
         "That should keep the planet going... at least a little longer." 

Wedge 
         "Yeah." 

Barret 
         "........." 

(Jessie plants an explosive against the pile of debris blocking their exit.) 

Jessie 
         "OK! Now everyone get back." 

(They stand back and a wall explodes, opening a way to a courtyard. Wedge's 
butt seems to be on fire.)

Barret 
         "All right, now let's get out of here." 
         "Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!" 

(They all exit except Barret and Cloud.) 

Cloud 
         "H, hey!" 

Barret 
         "If it's about your money save it 'til we're back at the hideout." 

(Barret exits. Cloud goes after him into the streets of Midgar.) 
  
  






Scene 3
- Flower Girl - A Daring Leap -

(A few people are running around a street corner, bumping into a woman 
standing there, knocking her down. She stands up and calmly brushes herself 
off. Cloud enters.) 

Flower girl 
         "Excuse me." 
         "What happened?" 

<CHOICE> 
         You'd better get out of here 
         Nothing... hey, listen... 

***Cloud 
         Nothing... hey, listen... 
         "........." 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't see many flowers around here 
         Never mind 

***Cloud 
         Don't see many flowers around here 

Flower girl 
         "Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil....?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Buy one 
         Forget it 

***Cloud 
         Buy one 

Flower girl 
         "Oh, thank you!" 
         "Here you are!" 
<//> 

(She gives Cloud a flower and walks off. Cloud continues through the 
streets of Midgar.) 

People on the street 
         "Just what the hell's going on!?" 

         "Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see..." 
         Don't be fooled by Shinra! Mako energy doesn't last forever! Mako 
is the planet's lifesource! The end is in sight! 
         Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE 

(Cloud reaches a dark street. A soldier patrolling the area spots him.) 

Soldier 
         "Hey! You there!" 

Cloud 
         "Shinra soldiers..." 

<CHOICE> 
         Fight them 
         Leave 

Cloud 
         Fight them 

(Three battles with Shinra soldiers. After the third battle, Cloud is 
surrounded) 

Soldier 
         "That's as far as you go." 

Cloud 
         "I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys." 

Soldier 
         "Enough babbling! Grab him!" 

(The soldiers close in. Cloud backs away, but his path is blocked as he 
reaches a railing. Below him are the train tracks. FMV sequence. Cloud 
jumps off the balcony onto the train as it rushes by.) 



  
  



Scene 4
- The Long Ride Home -

(Barret, Wedge, Biggs, and Jessie are riding in a train car littered with 
crates and junk.) 

Wedge 
         "Cloud never came." 

Biggs 
         "Cloud... Wonder if he was killed?" 

Barret 
         "No way!!" 

Jessie 
         "Cloud..." 

(There is thumping on the roof of the car. Barret glances up.) 

Biggs 
         "Say, do you think Cloud's..." 
         "Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?" 

Barret 
         "The hell would I know? Do I look like a mind reader?" 

(He hits a crate with his fist.) 

         "Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups..." 

Wedge 
         "Hey Barret! What about our money...?" 

(Barret hits the crate again.) 

Wedge 
         "Uh, nothin'... sorry." 
         "Ahh......." 

(The train door opens and Cloud flips into the car from above.) 

Biggs 
         "Cloud!!" 
Jessie 
         "Cloud..." 
Wedge 
         "Cloud!!" 

Cloud 
         "Looks like I'm a little late." 

Barret 
         "You damn right, you're late!!" 
         "Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!" 

Cloud 
         "It's no big deal. Just what I always do." 

Barret 
         "Shi't!" 
         "Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no 
one but yourself!" 

Cloud 
         "Hmm..... You were worried about me!" 

Barret 
         "Wha!?" 
         "I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!" 

(He walks to the center of the car.) 

Barret 
         "Wake up!" 
         "We're movin' out! Follow me!" 

(He exits the front of the car.) 

Wedge 
         "Hey, Cloud! You were great back there!" 

(He exits.) 

Biggs 
         "Heh heh.... Cloud! We'll do even better next time." 

(He exits.) 

Jessie 
         "Be careful, I'll shut this." 

(She closes the train door.) 

         "Oh, Cloud! Your face is pitch-black....." 

(She wipes his face.) 

         "There you go!" 
         "Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor!" 

(She exits. Cloud follows.) 
  

(The train intercom comes on.) 

         Last train out of Sector 8 Station. Last stop is Sector 7, Train 
Graveyard. Expected time of arrival is 12:23 AM, Midgar standard time... 

(Barret and the others come into the next car and sit down. They disturb a 
well-dressed, official looking man.) 

         "This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy..." 

(He leaves.) 

People on the train 

         "Huh? This is my house, so make yourselves at home." 

         "You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?" 
         "The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere 
in the slums." 
         "...blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this 
one." 
         "They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll 
do next?" 

Barret 
         "Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!" 

Wedge 
         "Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous ...and me, too!" 

Biggs 
         "It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet." 
         "I'm sure that will change by tomorrow." 

Jessie 
         "Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?" 
         "It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it
together. I'll explain it to you." 
         "I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know,
flashy stuff." 

(They look at the map.) 

Jessie 
         "Okay, it's about to start." 

(A wireframe of Midgar is shown on the map.) 

         "This is a complete model of the city of Midgar." 
         "It's about a 1/10000 scale." 
         "The top plate is about 50 meters above ground." 
         "A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and 
there are other support structures built in each section..." 
         "psst... whisper... whisper... (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was 
in the northern section.)" 
         "Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor." 
         "The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity." 
         "Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers 
them." 
         "Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's 
the kind of place this is." 
         "Phew..., this is next! Look." 

(A dotted line appears on the Midgar wireframe.) 

         "This is the route the train is on." 
         "The route spirals around the main support structure." 
         "We should be coming around the center area, right now." 
         "At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up." 
         "It can check the identities and background on each and every 
passenger on the train by linking it up to the central databank at Shinra 
headquarters." 
         "whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look 
suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)" 

(A red light starts flashing.) 

Jessie 
         "Speak of the devil..." 
         "That light means we're in the ID Security Check area." 
         "whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know 
what kind of creeps'll come out.)" 
         "...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief." 

Biggs 
         "...snore.... heebeebeeheebee... snore... (Don't act so damn big, 
Barret... snooze...)" 

Barret 
         "Look... you can see the surface now. This city don't have no 
day or night." 
         "If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky." 

(Cloud looks out the window.) 

Cloud 
         "A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery." 

(Barret gets up.) 

Barret 
         "Huh?" 
         "Never expect to hear that outta someone like you." 
         "...you jes' full of surprises." 

Barret 
         "The upper world... a city on a plate..." 
         "It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are 
sufferin'!" 
         "And the city below is full of polluted air." 
         "On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy." 

Cloud 
         "Then why doesn't everyone move onto the plate?" 

Barret 
         "Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe..." 
         "'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets." 

Cloud 
         "I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to." 
         "It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its 
rails take it." 

(FMV sequence. The train circles the support structure on its way to 
Sector 7. The train arrives at the station and everyone gets off) 

Barret 
         "Yo!! Get over here, all' ya!!" 

(Everyone gathers around Barret.) 

Barret 
         "This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now." 
         "The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that 
explosion!" 
         "'Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!" 
         "Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!" 

(All exit.) 






  
  
Scene 5
- The Reactor Tower -

People at the train station 

         "I'm not letting you go tonight." 

         "Wow!" 

         "Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?" 

         "There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say 
there's ghosts around too!" 

         "...damn." 

         "What?" 

Person near Reactor Tower 

         "Hey now! ...Oops!" 
         "What on earth are you doing? Just butt out... geez!" 
         "Huh? You come to see it, too?" 
         "There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, 
everyone in the slums is dust..." 
         "Well, there's no point in worryin' about that." 
         "Hey! Look! It's huge, ain't it?" 

(Cloud looks up at the massive steel tower.) 

         "Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place." 
         "This is my place, but you can come here when you want.
Bye, bro!" 

(He leaves.) 

Barret 

         "Yo. Cloud! Over here, now!" 
  
  
  



Scene 6
-Welcome Home, Cloud! - A Childhood Promise -

(Barret runs into Tifa's bar, the Seventh Heaven, and chases all the 
patrons out. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie go inside.) 

Barret 
         "Ok! Go on ahead." 

(If Cloud waits around outside) 

         "Yo! Cloud!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!" 

(Cloud enters the Seventh Heaven.) 

(Marlene jumps up.) 

         "Papa!" 

(She sees Cloud and hides in the corner. Tifa goes over to her) 

         "Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?" 

(She walks over to Cloud.) 

         "Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well." 
         "Did you fight with Barret?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah 
         Not this time 

***Cloud 
         Yeah 

Tifa 
         "I should have known." 
         "He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in 
fights ever since you were little." 
         "I was worried." 

***Cloud 
         Not this time 

Tifa 
         "Hmm. You've grown up." 
         "When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of 
a hat." 
<//> 

(The PLAYER names Tifa) 

Tifa 
         "Flowers? How nice..." 
         "You almost never see them here in the slums." 
         "But..." 
         "A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have..." 

Cloud 
         "No big." 

<CHOICE> 
         Give it to Tifa 
         Give it to Marlene 

***Cloud 
         Give it to Tifa 

Tifa 
         "Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful." 
         "Maybe I should fill the store with flowers." 

***Cloud 
         Give it to Marlene 

(Marlene grabs it and hides behind Tifa) 
<//> 

People in the bar 

Tifa 
         "Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy." 

Marlene 
         "............" 

Wedge 
         "Oh. Cloud!" 
         "Tifa realls knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm......." 
         "Anyway, let me tell you somethin'." 

<CHOICE> 
         About what? 
         I'm not interested in your stories 

***Cloud 
         About what? 

Wedge 
         "Tifa always lets me taste her cooking." 
         "And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly." 
         "Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good 
food and drinks that make this shop famous." 

***Cloud 
         I'm not interested in your stories 

Wedge 
         "Cloud...... ........forget it." 
<//> 

Jessie 
         "Careless..... You're getting all excited." 
         "Wonder what for.....?" 

Biggs 
         "Aah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job." 
         "Hic!!" 
         "Why don't you have one too?" 

<CHOICE> 
         No 
         Yeah, why not? 

***Cloud 
         No 

Biggs 
         "What!? you tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?" 
         "Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!" 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, why not? 

Biggs 
         "Oh!! That's more like it!" 
         "Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So 
you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!" 

Biggs 
         "Hic...!!" 
         "Oh..... Don't tell Barret what I jus said." 
<//> 

(Cloud tries to exit, but Barret crashes into the bar.) 

Marlene 
         "Papa, welcome home!" 

(Barret lifts her up on his shoulder.) 

<If you gave the flower to Marlene> 

Barret 
         "Yeah." 
         "Huh? Where'd you get that flower?" 

Marlene 
         "Cloud gave it to me." 

Barret 
         "Oh...." 

Barret 
         "Did you thank him?" 

Marlene 
         ".........." 
         "Thank you, Cloud." 
         "We'll take care of you." 
<//> 

Tifa 
         "You all right, Barret?" 

Barret 
         "Great!!" 
         "Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!" 

(He descends a hidden elevator in a pinball machine. Everyone follows but 
Cloud and Tifa. Cloud walks to the bar.) 

Tifa 
         "Sit down." 

(He sits.) 

Tifa 
         "How about..." 
         "...something to drink?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I don't feel like it 
         Give me something hard 

***Cloud 
         Give me something hard 

Tifa 
         "Just a minute. I'll make one for you." 

(She mixes Cloud a drink.) 

Tifa 
         "You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely." 

Cloud 
         "What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job." 

Tifa 
         "I guess not..." 
         "You were in SOLDIER." 

(Cloud sets down his drink.) 

Tifa 
         "Make sure you get your pay from Barret." 

Cloud 
         "Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here." 

***Cloud 
         I don't feel like it 

Tifa 
         "OHH!!" 
         "I can make a drink just as good as anyone else." 
         "Everyone says, my drinks taste the best!" 

<//> 

(Cloud gets up from the bar.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, are you feeling all right?" 

Cloud 
         "...yeah... Why?" 

Tifa 
         "No reason. You just look a little tired I guess." 
         "You'd better go down below." 

(Cloud walks to the elevator in the pinball machine and goes down. 
Everyone is busy downstairs. Barret is punching a bag.)

People downstairs 

Wedge 
         "You think I'm a litte too uptight?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah... 
         No... 

***Cloud 
         Yeah... 

Wedge 
         "The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor." 
         "Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?" 
         "Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be 
it." 

***Cloud 
         No... 

Wedge 
         "Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, 
but I'm a coward at heart." 

<//> 

(Jessie is working on the computer) 

Jessie 
         "Oops..." 
         "Hey, look at the news... What a blast." 
         "Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was 
just make it like the computer told me." 
         "Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere." 
  

Barret 
         "Yo. Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya." 
         "Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?" 

Cloud 
         "None. I'm positive." 

Barret 
         "You sound pretty sure." 

Cloud 
         "If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here 
now." 

Barret 
         "Don't go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER." 

Cloud 
         "......." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, you're strong." 
         "Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are." 
         "But don't forget your skinny ass's working for AVALANCHE now!" 
         "Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra." 

Cloud 
         "Stayin' with Shinra?" 
         "You asked me a question and I answered it... that's all." 
         "I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money." 
  

Barret 
         "Shucks!! ........money...." 

Marlene 
         "Papa. you're so great!" 
  

(Cloud moves to leave. Tifa runs in.) 

Tifa 
         "Wait, Cloud!" 

Barret 
         "Tifa! Let him go!" 
         "Looks like he still misses the Shinra!" 

Cloud 
         "Shut up!" 
         "I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER!" 
          "But don't get me wrong!" 
         "I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!" 
  

Tifa 
         "Straighten things up with everyone for me." 

Television 
         ......today the No.1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group 
AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing. 
         It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror. 
         But citizens of Midgar.... there is no need to fear. 
         I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry 
against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night. 

Wedge 
         "...Cloud." 
         "You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me." 
         "Cloud.... you just want friends." 
         "Isn't that right?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Blow off 
         I really don't care 

***Cloud 
         Blow off 

Wedge 
         "Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me." 
         If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can 
always talk to me." 

***Cloud 
         I really don't care 

Wedge 
         "You're terrible. Real cold blooded." 
<//> 

(Cloud goes back up the elevator and goes to leave. He is followed by Tifa.) 

Tifa 
         "Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us." 

Cloud 
         "Sorry Tifa..." 

Tifa 
         "The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying." 
         "Someone has to do something." 

Cloud 
         "So let Barret and his buddies do something about it." 
         "It's got nothin' to do with me." 

(He moves to leave) 

Tifa 
         "So! You're really leaving!?" 
         "You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood 
friend!?" 

Cloud 
         "What......?" 

<CHOICE> 
         How can you say that! 
     ...Sorry 

***Cloud 
         How can you say that! 

***Cloud 
         ...Sorry 

<//> 

Tifa 
         "You forgot the promise, too." 

Cloud 
         "Promise?" 

(Tifa looks down.) 

Tifa 
         "So you DID forget." 
         "Remember.... Cloud. It was seven years ago..." 

(Cloud looks up. The scene fades to black. It fades in again; Cloud and 
Tifa are standing by a well. The sky is full of stars.) 

Tifa 
         "Look, the well." 
         "Do you remember?" 

(Cloud nods.) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah.... back then." 

         "I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little
cold." 
  

(The scene changes. Cloud and Tifa, as children, appear. Cloud is
sitting swinging his legs on the well cover. Tifa enters from
offscreen.) 

Tifa 
         "Sorry I'm late." 

(She sits down.) 

Tifa 
         "You said you wanted to talk to me about something?" 

Cloud 
         "Come this spring.... I'm leaving this town for Midgar." 

Tifa 
         "........All boys are leaving our town." 

Cloud 
         "But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a 
job." 

(He stands.) 

         "I want to join SOLDIER." 

         "I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth." 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth.... The Great Sephiroth." 

(Cloud climbs to the top of the well and looks at the stars.) 

Tifa 
         "Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?" 

Cloud 
         "...I probably wont be able to come back to this town for a
while." 

(Tifa makes a motion.) 

Cloud 
         "...huh?" 

Tifa 
         "Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?" 

Cloud 
         "I'll try." 

Tifa 
         "Hey, why don't we make a promise?" 
         "Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind....." 
         "You come save me, all right?" 

Cloud 
         "What?" 

Tifa 
         "Whenever I"m in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me." 
         "I want to at least experience that once." 

Cloud 
         "What?" 

Tifa 
         "Come on--! Promise me----!" 

Cloud 
         "All right.... I promise." 

(The camera pans up to show the starry night sky. A falling star streaks 
its white trail across the dark blue.) 
  
  

(Back at the Seventh Heaven.) 

Tifa 
         "You remember now? ...Our promise?" 

Cloud 
         "I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep.... the promise." 

Tifa 
         "But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER." 

(Cloud looks down.) 

Tifa 
         "So come on! You've got to keep your promise......" 

(Barret climbs up the elevator.) 

Barret 
         "Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!" 
         "A promise is a promise! Here!!" 

(He tosses Cloud 1500 Gil.) 

Cloud 
         "This is my pay? Don't make me laugh." 

Tifa 
         "What? Then you'll...!!" 

Cloud 
         "You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000." 

Barret 
         "What....!?" 

(Tifa whispers to him.) 

Tifa 
         "It's ok, it's ok." 
         "psst, psst..... (We're realy hurting for help, right?)" 

Barret 
         "Uh..... ugh..... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)" 

(Barret turns.) 

Barret 
         "2000!" 

(Tifa walks to Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "Thanks, Cloud." 



  
  



Scene 7
- The Morning After - Sector 7 -

(The scene changes to Tifa's bar, the next morning. Cloud goes up the 
elevator. Tifa and Barret are standing, Marlene is mixing drinks.) 

Tifa 
         "Good Morning! Cloud!" 
         "Did you sleep well?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Barret's snoring kept me up...... 
         Next to you, who wouldn't? 

***Cloud 
         Barret's snoring kept me up.... 

Tifa 
         "psstpsst..." 
         "(keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an 
operation.)" 

***Cloud 
         Next to you, who wouldn't? 

Tifa 
         "I don't know what you mean." 
<//> 

Tifa 
         "I'm going this time." 

Barret 
         "Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first." 
         "I'll fill you in on the train." 

Barret 
         "Yo! Cloud!" 
         "Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!" 
         "I, uh,..... I don't really know how to use Materia!" 
         "I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use 
it!" 

Cloud 
         "...sigh..." 

<CHOICE> 
         Ok, I'll explain it 
         You wouldn't understand 

***Cloud 
         Ok, I'll explain it 

(Cloud explains the Materia system.) 

         Sure. I'll explain how Materia works. 
         First, access the menu. 
         You know the basic functions. 
         The triangle button brings up the menu. 
         Directional buttons move the cursor. Like this. 
         Select each menu by  using the OK button. 
         If you want to leave the menu, 
         just push the CANCEL cutton. 
         See? Let's go ahead. 
         Now you're in this menu. 
         Select [Materia] sub menu. 
         Select who you want to use it. 
         Now look at my weapon here. 
         Each weapon and armor has slots in it. 
         Choose which slot you want to put Materia in. 
         Now select the Materia you want to use. 
         This is curative Materia. 
         If you want to know what its effect is, 
         line the cursor up with [Check], 
         and push the OK button. 
         It's just like selecting battle commands. 
         Just line the cursor up to [Magic], 
         you can see that the available magic has increased. 
         Now you can use new magic [Cure]. 
         And that's all there is to equipping Materia. 
         See? It wasn't that tough! 
         When you want to remove any Materia, 
         it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, 
         and pushing the triangle button. 
         There's just one thing you have to be careful of. 
         Whenever you equip Materia, 
         your situation changes. 
         Parts of you may become stronger... 
         while others get weaker. 
         Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, 
         your magic power will get stronger. 
         But your physical strength weakens. 
         So, Materia's kind of a double'edged sword. 
         On the left side of the screen, 
         you can see the Materia's effect on you. 
         It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia. 
         But try out various things. 
         Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu. 
         Ok, that's about it. 
         I'll give you some advanced tips later. 
  
Barret 
         "Shi....! What's this 'It wasn't that tough' crap!" 
         "I'm clueless......" 
         "Well, you handle the Materia then!" 

***Cloud 
         You wouldn't understand 

Barret 
        "So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?" 
         "Ok, I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the 
Materia!" 
<//> 

 [Materia System] Access the menu and select [Materia] to equip Materia. 

Tifa 
         "Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs." 
         "He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!" 

         "Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!" 

Marlene 
         "All right! Good Luck." 
  
(Cloud explores Sector 7.) 

Johnny 
         "I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better 
man! This is goodbye!" 
         "Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of Tifa!" 

(He exits.) 

People in Sector 7 

         "Ah... Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed." 
         "I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when
I'm not drinking." 

         "I hope he doesn't get hurt." 
         "That worries me the most." 

         "Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you
from outside the bar." 
         "Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one!" 

         "Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!" 

         "He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was
here, but now that he's gone.... I kind of miss him." 
         "......strange, isn't it?" 

         "Ha! Ha!..... I wonder if my son's already left?" 
         "When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome 
it gets." 

         "Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of 
getting gossip on everyone?" 
         "Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!" 
         "I'll get a little more information that would pique even your 
interest. You wait and see!" 

         "You dried up old geez. You tired?" 
         "Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house? 
         "There's just one condition." 
         "You gotta give me some cash." 
         <1 gil>  "Damn, man!! Just forget about it!" 
         <10 gil> "Oh man, oh man..." 
         "Go ahead and help yourself to the room." 
         "Use whatever bed you want. Sleep tight, old guy." 
         <nothin'> "Cheap %#*^......" 
         <If you go in bedroom without paying> "This is a slum, so don't 
think you can stay for free." 
         "What are you going to do?" 
         "Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?" 
         <10 gil> "Sweet dreams, pops." 
         <no way> "Tough guy, huh!? You better sleep when you
can." 
         "You'd better save when you can." 
         "That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude." 

         "This is the Beginner's Hall." 
         "You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not." 

Cloud 
         "Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you
how much I know.... an' for free too!" 
         <Cloud gives a tutorial here> 

         <pick up an "All" Materia> 
         "Hey! You got one right off!" 
         "That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!" 

         "This is the fabled [Save Point]!!" 
         "At a [Save Pont] you can use a [tent] and/or select *SAVE*." 
         "There's more, too. Look for something called secret." 
         "Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that 
same point." 
         "That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out." 
         "This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar..." 
         "Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. 
Remember that." 
         That should be all you need to know about the Save Point. 
         I'll probably see you again somewhere on the road. 
         Take care! 
         I'm a [treasure chest]!! Beginners make sure and keep an eye out 
for me!! 

(Two kids fighting) 
Cloud 
         "You've got to hang in there. Your limit gauge is just starting 
to build." 
         "Waaah!" 
Cloud 
         "OK! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight 
with your limit techinique." 
(The kid wins the fight.) 
         "Great!" 

(Two kids fighting) 
         "Magic! Magic!" "Help!" 
Cloud 
         "Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic 
Barrier] or [reflect]." 
         "[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage recieved from magic by half." 
         "[Reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times 
you can use it is limited so be careful." 
(The kid wins the fight.) 
         "Great!" 

(Two kids fighting) 
         "Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too!" 
         "Me too!" 
Cloud 
         "If you want to get as stong as me you need to use Materia." 
         "And you have to find the best combinations of them." 
         "The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will 
determine how quickly your Materia grows." 
         "Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The 
possible combinations are limitless." 
         "That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you 
have to have some natural talent." 
        (kids) "I still don't get it!" 
Cloud 
         "Listen kid, don't piss me off!" 
         "That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll 
get used to it." 

         "Hey SOLDIER! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!" 
Cloud 
         "I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But 
I'll rap with you for a while." 
        <Cloud gives battle tutorial here> 

         "Heh heh... He'll forget about it. OH, you!" 
         "Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya." 

         "He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!" 
         "You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'...." 
         "Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean." <sells 
weapons> 

         "Ahh... Another slow day..." 
         "If this keeps up, this store's goin' under...." 
         "Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this." 
         "Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. You a....... 
customer?" 
         "Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!" 



  
  



Scene 8
- The Train - A Narrow Escape -

(Cloud arrives at the train station. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are waiting 
there.) 

People at the station 

         "I've had it!" 

         "Me too." 

         "You know this is the first time we've ever agreed on something." 

         "Yes..." 

         "Well then, shall we.....?" 

         "Yes......" 

 (They snog.) 

(Cloud approaches the train and eveyone gets on.) 

Barret 
         "YO!" 
         "Looks like this ain't no private car! So split up!" 

(They meet the well-dressed Shinra manager again.) 

         "....hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck..." 

Barret 
         "You say sumthin'?" 
         "I said, 'you say sumthin'!?" 

(Barret walks over to the man.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, look at that! It got empty alluva sudden." 
         "What's goin' on?" 

         "DAMN!" 
         "I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you..." 

(Barret smacks him.) 

         "Y, Y, YIPES!!" 
         "You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be 
more bombings." 
         "Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like 
today." 

Barret 
         "You workin' for Shinra?" 

Shinra Manager 
         "I won't give in to violence..." 

Tifa 
         "Barret!!" 

Barret 
         "&$#%!! You lucky ^$#$,!" 

(Barret and Tifa run to the back of the car.) 

Cloud 
         "So, what are we going to do now?" 

Barret 
         "Shit! the hell you so calm about? you bustin up my rhythm..." 

(The train starts moving.) 

Tifa 
         "Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally 
leaving."

Cloud 
         "So what's our next target?" 

Barret 
         "Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!" 
         "Awright.... I'll tell ya!" 
         "Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security
check point at the top plate." 
         "It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains." 

Tifa 
         "Which Shinra is very proud of." 

Barret 
         "We can't use our fake ID's anymore..." 

(The train intercom comes on.) 

         Good Morning, and welcome to  Midgar Lines. Arrival time at 
Sector 4 station will be 11:45. 

Tifa 
         "That means we've only got three more minutes to the ID Check 
point." 

(Barret runs forward.) 

Barret 
         "Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train." 
         "Got it!?" 

(He sits.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor." 
  

People on the Train 

         "Hmm....? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my 
house." 
         "I'm impressed." 

Shinra Manager 
         "Waaaaah!!" 
         "Don... don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...!! I'm 
gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)" 
  

(Cloud looks at the map with Tifa.) 

Tifa 
         "Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already..." 
         "It's all right. Come a little closer." 

(A red light starts flashing.) 

Tifa 
         "That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down." 
  

         Type A Security Alert!!! 
         Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be 
conducted! 
         Repeat!! Type A Security Alert!! 
         Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be 
conducted! 

Tifa 
         "What's happening?" 

Barret 
         "What's goin' on!!" 

(Jessie rushes in.) 

Jessie 
         "We're in trouble." 
         "I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!" 

Barret 
         "^%#@%! Someone blew it..." 

         Unidentified passengers located in Car #1 
         Preparing for Lock Down 

Barret 
         "Let's go! Keep it up!" 

(They rush to the next car.) 

         Car #1: Locked Down 
         Upgrading to Level 2 warning 

Biggs 
         "Hurry!" 

Wedge 
         "They're gonna lock the door, sir!" 

         Unidentified passengers located in Car #2 
         Preparing for Lock Down 

Jessie 
         "Just run!" 
         "Changing to Plan 2!" 

People in Car #2 

         "Gosh! You're adults but you're making such noise!" 
         "Please behave while on the train!" 

         "Does this mean we're in a major bind?" 

(They rush to the next car.) 

         Car #2: Locked Down 
         Upgrading to Warning Level 3 

(The light stops flashing.) 

Barret 
         "Awright! We clear!?" 

Jessie 
         "Not yet. They're starting another search. If we're caught, we're 
done for!" 
         "But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should 
get past it!" 

(Jessie breaks her way out. Light starts flashing again.) 

         Unidentified Passengers: 
         Moving to front of Train 
         Currently tracking location 

People on the train 

         "Hee hee!" 

Johnny 
         "Later... goodbye... adios, Midgar!" 

(They reach Car #4.) 

         Car #4: Locked Down 
         Upgrading to maximum security alert!! 

(Barret runs to the front of the car.) 

Barret 
         "All right!! We made it!" 
         "Yo! This way!!" 

(He opens the door of the train.) 

         "Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!" 

Tifa 
         "Scary... huh." 

Cloud 
         "Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?" 

Tifa 
         "Because..." 

Barret 
         "Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!" 

(They get ready to jump.) 

People in Car #4 

(Jessie is disguised as a Shinra soldier) 

Jessie 
         "It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud?" 
         "Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?" 

<yeah...> 
Cloud 
         "You look great, just like a man." 

Jessie 
         "Yay!! I'm so happy.... I think?" 

<Not now> 
Cloud 
         "Just concentrate on our plan." 

Jessie 
         "You're right, sorry." 
  <//> 

Tifa 
         "Yeah!! I've made up my mind." 
         "Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!" 

(She does so.) 

Cloud 
         "You don't care if I go first?" 

Barret 
         "A leader always stays till the end." 
         "Don't worry 'bout me, just go!" 

(Cloud moves to the door.) 

         "Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!" 
         "It's only the beginnin' of the mission!" 

(Cloud jumps.) 

Barret 
         "Later! You take care of the rest!" 

(Barret jumps.) 



  
  



Scene 9
- Reactor #5 - President Shinra -

(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa land in an underground subway.) 

Barret 
         "Good, so far everything's going as planned." 

(He walks down a bit.) 

         "Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 
reactor." 
         "Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it." 
         "Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!" 

(They walk down the tunnel, until they reach a grid of laser beams crossing 
the tunnel.) 

Cloud 
         "Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go 
any further." 

(They see a ventilation duct in the wall.) 

Barret 
         "That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that 
to get under the Plate? No way!" 
         "Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Look inside closely 
         Go down 
         Don't go down 

***Cloud 
         Look inside closely 

Tifa 
         "There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct." 

Cloud 
         "Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up 
here." 

Barret 
         "Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us." 
         "Cloud, you jes' gotta go." 

<CHOICE> 
         Go down 
         Don't go down 
(Same results as from the previous menu.) 

***Cloud 
         Go down 

Barret 
         "But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills." 

(They climb into the duct.) 

***Cloud 
         Don't go down 

Barret 
         "Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way
of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here." 

<//> 
  
  
  

(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa enter the ventilation ducts and work their way 
into the Reactor. Along the way they meet Wedge, Jessie and Biggs.) 

Wedge 
         "Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder." 

Jessie 
         "I'm sorry." 
         "The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault." 
         "I made your ID card special... So that's why it happened." 
         "I put my heart into making it. But I failed." 

(She shakes her head.) 

Jessie 
         "Next time, I'll give you something more decent." 
         "I'll be back at the hideout in the research room workin' on it." 

Biggs 
         "We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout." 
         "Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!" 

(He exits.) 

(The three work their way deeper until they reach the core. The
screen goes red and Cloud clutches his head and falls to his knees.
The scene shifts as Cloud hallucinates. He sees the inside of a
Mako Reactor. Gears are spinning. On the floor lies a long, thin
sword. Tifa, as a younger girl, sometime between the well
flashback and the present, kneels on the floor. A man lies before
her, dead.) 

Tifa 
         "Papa..." 
         "Sephiroth!?" 

(She sits up.) 

         "Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?" 

(She shakes her fists and looks skyward.) 

         "Sephiroth.... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!" 

(She rises; then, vehemently) 

         "I hate them all!" 

(She picks up the sword on the floor and runs into the reactor core.) 
  

(Cloud comes out of his hallucination. The scene changes back to Reactor 
No. 5.) 

Barret 
         "Damn man, get a hold of yourself!" 

(Tifa kneels by Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "You all right?" 

(He rises.) 

Cloud 
         "......Tifa." 

Tifa 
         "Mmm?" 

Cloud 
         "No... forget...... Come on, let's hurry!" 

(Cloud plants a bomb in the reactor. They hurry out. They reach a 
mechanism with three buttons.) 

Tifa 
         "Jessie said we all have to the buttons at once." 

(They do so. A door opens and they hurry through onto a walkway.) 

Barret 
         "This way!" 

(His way is blocked.) 

         "Shinra soldiers!?" 
         "SHIT! What the hell's goin' on?" 

Cloud 
         "...a trap..." 

(We hear footsteps, then, Shinra theme music.) 

Barret 
         "President Shinra?" 

Tifa 
         "Why is the President here?" 

(The Shinra President walks onto the walkway, his expensive shoes echoing.) 

President Shinra 
         "Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?" 

Barret 
         "AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, 
huh?" 

(Cloud steps forward.) 

Cloud 
         "Long time no see, President." 

President Shinra 
         "...Long time no see? Oh... you." 
         "You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew 
you were exposed to Mako, from the glow in your eyes..." 
         "Tell me, traitor... what was your name?" 

Cloud 
         "Cloud." 

President Shinra 
         "Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each 
person's name." 
         "Unless you become another Sephiroth." 
         "Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant..." 

(Cloud steps back.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth.....?" 

(Barret runs forward.) 

Barret 
         "Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place'e goin' up with 
a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!" 

President Shinra 
         "And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin 
like you..." 

Barret 
         "VERMIN? That's all you can say... VERMIN!" 
         "Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes 
you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!" 

President Shinra 
         "...You are beginning to bore me." 
         "I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner 
I must attend." 

(Barret runs right up to him.) 

Barret 
         "Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!" 

President Shinra 
         "But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all." 

(President Shinra snaps his fingers...) 

Tifa 
         "!? What's that noise?" 

(Barret runs back.) 

Barret 
         "The hell is this!?" 

(A huge robot buzzes in and looks menacing.) 

President Shinra 
         "Meet 'Airbuster,' a techno-soldier,. Our Weapon Development 
Department created him." 
         "I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be
of great use to us in future experiments." 

Cloud 
         "...Techno-soldier?" 

(A helicopter hovers up to the walkway.) 

President Shinra 
         "Now then, if you'll excuse me." 

(Cloud runs forward, too late to intercept him. President Shinra boards 
the helicopter and flies away... leaving Cloud and the others alone with 
Airbuster.) 

Cloud 
         "Wait, President!" 

(Barret turns toward Airbuster.) 

Barret 
         Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' about him!" 

(Airbuster buzzes toward Barret and Tifa.) 

Tifa 
         "Help, Cloud!" 

(Cloud runs in behind it.) 

Tifa 
         "THIS is from SOLDIER?" 

Cloud 
         "No way! It's just a machine." 

(Airbuster spins.) 

Barret 
         "I don't care what it is! I'm gonna bust him up!" 

(Boss battle with Airbuster) 
  
  

(Airbuster explodes, taking half the walkway with it. Cloud is left 
hanging from a piece of broken metal. It's a long way down.) 

Barret 
         "It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!" 

Tifa 
         "Barret! Can't you do something?" 

Barret 
         "Not a damn thing." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much
I want to tell you!" 

Cloud 
         "I know, Tifa......" 

Barret 
         "Hey, you gonna be awright?" 

<CHOICE> 
         (Be strong) 
         (I don't know if I can hold on...) 

***Cloud 
         (Be strong) 

Cloud 
         ".........." 
         "You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of Tifa!" 

Barret 
         "...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this." 

Cloud 
         "Stop talkin' like this is the end!" 

***Cloud 
         (I don't know if I can hold on....) 

Cloud 
         "Shit! Can't hold on much longer. Barret..... Hurry!" 

Barret 
         "Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for 
ya. Ya gotta do it yourself." 

Cloud 
         "Barret..." 
<//> 

Barret 
         "Alright, then, later." 

(FMV sequence: the bomb explodes, knocking Cloud from the walkway. Tifa 
tries to grab him, but he is too far away. Cloud plummets from the upper 
plate down to the slums below.) 


  
  




Scene 10
- Flowers Blooming In The Church -

         ...You all right? 
         ...Can you hear me? 

Cloud 
         ".....Yeah....." 

         Back then... You could get by with just skinned knees..... 

Cloud 
         "What do you mean by 'back then'?" 

         What about now? Can you get up? 

Cloud 
         ".....What do you mean by 'that time'? .....What about now?" 

         Don't worry about me. You just worry about yourself now. 

Cloud 
         ".....I'll give it a try." 

         "Oh! He moved!" 

         .....How about that? 
         Take it slow now. Little by little..... 

         "Hello, hello?" 

Cloud 
         ".....I know." 

Cloud 
         "Hey... who are you?" 

         "Hello, hello!" 

(The scene fades in to show Cloud lying in the middle of a flower patch 
in the floor of an old church. The Flower Girl from Midgar kneels next to 
him. She stands. Cloud manages to sit up.) 

         "You okay?" 
         "This is a church in the Sector 5 slums." 
         "You suddenly fell on top of me. You really gave me quite a
scare." 

Cloud 
         "......I came crashing down?" 

         "The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall.
You're lucky." 

Cloud 
         "Flower bed... is this yours?" 

(He stands up and brushes his clothes off.) 

Cloud 
         "Sorry about that." 

         "That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because 
this is a sacred place." 
         "They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar." 
         "But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here." 
         "I love it here." 

(She begins to tend to her flowers.) 

         ".....So, we meet again." 
         "Don't you remember me?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, I remember you 
         Never saw you before 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, I remember you 
         "Yeah, I remember..." 

<CHOICE> 
         You were selling flowers 
         You're the slum drunk 

 ***Cloud 
         You were selling flowers 

         "Oh, I"m so happy!" 
         "Thanks for buying my flowers." 

***Cloud 
         You're the slum drunk 

(She makes an angry motion) 

         "Excuse me, but that's really rude!" 
         "But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me." 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         Never saw you before 

         ".....I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze." 
         "But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me." 
<//> 

         "Say, do you have any materia?" 

Cloud 
         "Yes, some." 
         "Nowadays you can find materia anywhere." 

         "But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing." 

Cloud 
         ".....good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use 
it." 

         "No, I do... it just doesn't do anything." 
         "I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's...." 

(She looks skyward.) 

         "Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?" 
         "After all, here we are meeting again, right?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I don't mind 
         Got nothing to talk about 

***Cloud 
         I don't mind 

         "Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll be just a minute." 

***Cloud 
         Got nothing to talk about 

(She looks sad and disappointed.) 

         "....oh, I see." 
         "Ahhh, I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, 
you know. Poor flowers." 
<//> 

(She checks her flowers.) 

         "Just a little longer." 
         "Oh!" 
         "Now that you mention it....." 
         "We don't know each other's names, do we?" 
         "My name is...." 

(The PLAYER names Aerith) 

         "I'm Aerith, the flower girl. Nice to meet you." 

Cloud 
         "The name's Cloud." 
         "Me.....? I do a little bit of everything." 

Aerith 
         "Oh.... a jack of all trades." 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, I do whatever's needed." 

(Aerith giggles.) 

Cloud 
         "What's so funny? What are you laughing at?" 

Aerith 
         "Sorry..... I just..." 

(They turn to see a mysterious figure in the doorway of the church....) 








Scene 11
- Meet Reno -

(Cloud and Aerith are in an old church. They turn to see a mysterious 
figure in the doorway...) 

Aerith 
         "Sorry, bad timing on my part." 

(Cloud moves toward the person.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud! Don't let it get to you!" 

(She steps back, behind Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?" 
         "You DO do everything, right?" 

(Cloud smooths his hair.) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, that's right." 

Aerith 
         "Then, get me out of here. Take me home." 

Cloud 
         "OK, I'll do it... but it'll cost you." 

Aerith 
         "Well then, let's see......" 
         "How about if I go out with you once?" 

(Cloud makes an affirmative nod. He confronts the person.) 

Cloud 
         "I don't know who you are, but...." 

         "You don't know me.....?" 

         ......I know you. 

(The screen goes white, briefly) 

Cloud 
         "Oh yeah...... I know you." 
         "That uniform...." 

(Three Shinra guards run in.) 

         ".....Hey, sis, this one's a little weird." 

Cloud 
         "Shut up! You Shinra spy!" 

         "Reno! Want him taken out?" 

Reno 
         "I haven't decided yet." 

Aerith 
         "Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!" 

(Cloud and Aerith run to the back of the church.) 

Aerith 
         "The exit is back there." 

(They exit. Reno walks forward, OVER the flower patch...) 

Reno 
         "They were..... Mako eyes." 
         "Yeah, all right. Back to work,
back to work." 

(He exits.) 

Reno 
         "Oh!" 

(He re-enters.) 

         "And don't step on the
flowers......" 

(The three guards speak in unison) 

         "Hey Reno, you just stepped on them!" 
         "They're all ruined!" 
         "You're gonna catch holy hell!" 

  






Scene 12
- Flee The Church -

(The scene changes. Cloud and Aerith in the back room of the church. It is 
three floors high, and a large Shinra missle apparently crashed through 
them all, leaving gaping holes in them. They jump past the missile and 
climb a broken flight of stairs, reaching a break in the walkway.) 

Reno 
         "There they are, over there!" 

(Reno comes in with the three guards.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud... that one!" 

Cloud 
         "I know... Looks like they aren't
going to let us go." 

Aerith 
         "What should we do?" 

Cloud 
         "Well we can't let them catch us,
can we? Then, there's only one thing left." 

(He jumps across the gap and motions for Aerith to follow.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith! This way!" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Cloud 
         "All right. I'll hold them off." 

Aerith 
         "Right. Make sure they don't get through!" 

Reno 
         "The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! Attack!" 

(The guards fire at Aerith who falls from the walkway.) 

Aerith 
         "Eaygh!!" 

Cloud 
         "Aerith!" 

Reno 
         "Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say!" 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, help!" 

Cloud 
         "Damn!" 

(He looks up to the rafters.) 

         "What's that...?" 

(The three guards attack Aerith. Cloud runs to the rafters and finds four 
barrels. He pushes them off, squashing each guard. The PLAYER controls 
this.) 

Aerith 
         "Thanks, Cloud." 

(Aerith runs up to the rafters.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith, this way." 

(She follows Cloud. They find a hole in the roof of the church and jump 
out to the outside.) 




  



Scene 13
- Let's Go, Bodyguard! -

(Cloud and Aerith are sitting on the roof of Aerith's old church.) 

Aerith 
         "Ha, ha..... They're looking for me again." 

Cloud 
         "You mean it's not the first time
they've been after you?" 

Aerith 
         "...no." 

Cloud 
         "They're the Turks." 

Aerith 
         "Hmmm......" 

Cloud 
         "The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible 
candidates for SOLDIER." 

Aerith 
         "This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone." 

Cloud 
         "They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side." 
         "Spying, murder... you know." 

Aerith 
         "They look like it." 

Cloud 
         "But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?" 

Aerith 
         "No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be 
in SOLDIER!" 

Cloud 
         "Maybe you do. You want to join?" 

Aerith 
         "I don't know... But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!" 

Cloud 
         "Then, let's go!" 

(Aerith follows Cloud. They jump across many rooftops and pieces of 
debris, heading away from the church. Cloud gets far ahead of her.) 

Aerith 
         "Wait... Wait, I said!" 

(She catches up, carefully, femininely judging each gap.) 

         "Puff... wheeze..." 
         "Slow.... down.... Don't leave me...." 

Cloud 
         "Funny..." 
         "I thought you were cut out to be
in SOLDIER?" 

Aerith 
         "Oh! You're terrible!" 

(Cloud laughs.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey.... Cloud. Were you ever in
SOLDIER?" 

Cloud 
         "....." 
         "...I used to be. How did you guess?" 

Aerith 
         "...Your eyes. They have a strange glow..." 

Cloud 
         "That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako..." 
         "A mark of SOLDIER." 
         "But, how did you know about that?" 

Aerith 
         "........Oh, nothing." 

Cloud 
         "Nothing....?" 

Aerith 
         "Right, nothing!" 
         "Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!" 

(Cloud continues across the rooftops. Aerith follows, more closely.) 




  



Scene 14
- Sneak Out At Midnight -

(Cloud and Aerith hop down from the rooftops across pieces of debris. They 
land on a dirt road) 

Aerith 
         "Whew! Finally made it off! Now what..." 

(She looks around, then scampers
forward) 

         "My house is over here. Let's
hurry before they get here!" 

(Cloud and Aerith travel through the
Sector 5 slums to Aerith's small cottage.
They go inside.) 

Aerith 
         "I'm home, mom." 

(Her mother, Elmyra, walks over.) 

         "This is Cloud, my bodyguard." 

Elmyra 
         "Bodyguard.....? You mean you were followed again!?" 
         "Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?" 

Aerith 
         "I'm all right. I had Cloud with me." 

(Elmyra nods.) 

Elmyra 
         "Thank you, Cloud." 

(She goes upstairs.) 

Aerith 
         "So, what are you going to do now?" 

Cloud 
         "...Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to Tifa's bar." 

Aerith 
         "Is Tifa...... a girl?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah." 

Aerith 
         "A girl... friend?" 

Cloud 
         "Girlfriend?" 

<CHOICE> 
         No way 
         Yeah, that's right 

***Cloud 
         No way! 

(Cloud shakes his head quickly.) 

Aerith 
         "Hee hee hee...." 
         "You don't have to get THAT upset..." 

(She moves toward Cloud... a small step.) 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, that's right 

Aerith 
         "Oh, how nice." 

<//> 

Aerith 
         "Well, that's... nice." 
         "Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you
the way." 

Cloud 
         "You gotta be kidding. Why do
you want to put yourself in danger
again?" 

Aerith 
         "I'm used to it." 

Cloud 
         "Used to it!?" 
         "....Well, don't know... getting
help from a girl..." 

(She makes an amusedly angry gesture.) 

Aerith 
         "A girl!! What do you mean by that!?" 
         "You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say 
something like that!?" 

(She calls upstairs.) 

         "Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while." 

(Elmyra comes downstairs.) 

Elmyra 
         "But dear... I give up. You never listen once you've made up your 
mind." 
         "But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late 
now." 

Aerith 
         "Yeah, you're right, mom." 

Elmyra 
         "Aerith, please go and make the bed." 

(Aerith goes upstairs. Cloud speaks to Elmyra.) 

Elmyra 
         "That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah. Rather I used to be..." 

Elmyra 
         ".... I don't know how to say this, but..." 
         "Would you please leave here, tonight?" Without telling Aerith." 

(Cloud goes upstairs. Aerith meets him.) 

Aerith 
         "You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is 
a little"
         "dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight." 

(Cloud walks toward the bedroom door.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud...." 

(He turns to her.) 

Aerith 
         "Good night." 

(She goes downstairs.) 

Cloud 
         "Oh, man..." 

(Cloud goes to bed. He dreams, we presume.) 

         "...seem pretty tired......" 

Cloud 
         ".......!?" 

         "I haven't slept in a bed like this ....in a long time." 

Cloud 
         "....Oh, yeah." 

         "Ever since that time." 

(The scene fades in. Cloud is lying on a bed in a one-room house. A woman 
is in the room, working in the kitchen area. She stops and walks toward 
him.) 

         "My, how you've grown." 
         "I'll bet the girls never leave you alone." 

Cloud 
         "...Not really." 

(She paces a bit.) 

         "...I'm worried about you." 
         "There are a lot of temptations in
the city..." 
         "I'd feel a lot better if you just
settled down and had a nice girlfriend." 

Cloud 
         "...I'm all right." 

         "You should have..." 
         "an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you." 
         "I think that would be the perfect type for you." 

Cloud 
         "I'm not interested." 

(The scene fades back in. Cloud is lying on a bed on the second floor of 
Aerith's house. Aerith is in the next room.) 

Cloud 
         "...I must've fallen asleep." 

(He gets up.) 

Cloud 
         "Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself..." 

(He sneaks past Aerith's room and goes downstairs. He exits the house, 
leaving Aerith behind.) 




  



Scene 15
- Playground Ai -

People in Sector 5 

         "Take care of yourself. It's the law of the slums. But to do 
that, first, you need weapons, right?" (Sells weapons) 

         "Hmph.....! Everything President Shinra says is a lie." 
         "But then again, you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you 
call them." 
         "You can bat it around all you like. But in the end it comes 
down to wanting to be like those who live up above." 
         "So who do you believe in? Oneself! Me! I never lie to myself, 
that's for sure!" 

         (TV) "And now for the news." 
         "Due to a terrorist attack by the group named AVALANCHE, parts of 
Midgar that were temporarily out of power will be restored momentarily." 
         "Following President Shinra's lead, Mayor Domino also spoke out 
public against AVALANCHE." 

         "glug... glug..." 
         "Now... no one... will find it... num..." 
         "The top one... and the bottom one..." 

         "...stare... hmph... we only trade items for gil here." (Sells 
items) 

         "I don't care if it's scrap metal or materia. We can get anything 
here in the slums." 
         "Got a lot of good materia here. Why don't you look it over?" 
(Sells materia) 

         "ooh.... aaah..... aghhhh...." 
  
(On the way out of the city, Cloud runs into Aerith. He looks startled.) 

Aerith 
         "You're up bright and early." 

Cloud 
         "How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be 
dangerous?" 

Aerith 
         "Are you done?" 

(Cloud smooths his hair.) 

         "You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th 
Heaven." 
         "I'll take you there. Come on!" 

(Aerith runs out. Cloud follows. They cross a highway that has been 
more or less demolished until they reach an old playground.) 

Aerith 
         "The gate to Sector 7's in there." 

Cloud 
         "Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going 
home?" 

Aerith 
         "Oh no! 'Whatever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to 
say?" 

<CHOICE> 
         See her home 
         Take her to Sector 7 

***Cloud 
         See her home 

Aerith 
         "Isn't that a little out of the way?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, I guess so." 

***Cloud 
         Take her to Sector 7 

Aerith 
         "I could do that. But won't I be in your way?" 

Cloud 
         "What do you mean in the way?" 

Aerith 
         "Nothing!" 

<//> 

(Aerith puts her hands behind her back and looks up at Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "Can we take a break?" 

(She walks to a large, moogle-shaped children's slide.) 

Aerith 
         "I can't believe it's still here." 

(She climbs to the top) 

         "Cloud, get over here!" 

(He climbs up and sits beside her.) 

Aerith 
         "What rank were you?" 

Cloud 
         "Rank?" 

Aerith 
         "You know, in SOLDIER." 

Cloud 
         "Oh, I was..." 

(The screen goes solid white, briefly.) 

         "First Class." 

Aerith 
         "Just the same as him." 

Cloud 
         "The same as who?" 

Aerith 
         "My first boyfriend." 

Cloud 
         "You were... serious?" 

Aerith 
         "No. But I liked him for a while." 

Cloud 
         "I probably knew him. What was his name?" 

(Aerith shakes her head.) 

Aerith 
         "It doesn't really matter." 

(A huge gate opens in the back. A large carriage drawn by a chocobo comes 
out. A woman is riding in the back.) 

Cloud 
         "Huh? Hey, back there....." 

(He stands up) 

Cloud 
         "Tifa!?" 

(The carriage drives out and the gate closes.) 

Aerith 
         "That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked 
kind of odd..." 

(She hops down and chases the cart.) 

Cloud 
         "Wait!" 
         "I'll go on alone! You go home!" 

(She doesn't listen. She chases the carriage offscreen. Cloud shakes his 
head and goes after her.) 








Scene 16
- Miss Cloud? -

(Cloud and Aerith arrive in Wall Market, busy with the hustle and 
bustle of people. Aerith runs around, checking things out.) 

Aerith 
         "This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So 
we've got to find Tifa fast." 

People in Wall Market 

         "I just can't make up my mind. Mmm." 
         "Huh? About what?" 
         "Hmmm, don't make me say it. It's the shop down on the right." 

         "Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?" 
         "We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?" 

         "Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?" 

         "Hey boy! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there!" 
         "Take her to Don's place, and you'll make a mint." 

         "Whoa!" 
         "Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?" 
(Sells items) 

         "Please come in. Here's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter 
now."

(People in the Cafe) 
         "Welcome! Sit wherever you like!" 
         "I'm gonna get another Pharmacy Coupon today." 
         "umf... scarf... glub..." 
         "I always get the Special." 
         "It's thanks to the Don that we can eat like this." 
         "umf... grunt... smack... Don't sneak up on me like that!" 

         "It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit." 

         "...We're closed now." 

         "Oh... what should I do... Should I just buy it......?" 

         "Welcome. Please take your time." 

         "Don't push! Hooligan!" 

         "All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?" 
         "All this, belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps 
picking things up and saving them here." 
         "Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop." 
         "But no matter how you look at it, it's just trash..." 

         "Join the club." 
         "Try it with us." 

         "All right... 1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm." 
         "I'm doing my best, bro'!" 
         "How's... this!?" 

         "Whew, times are bad." 

         "...And then..." 
         "Hmm, hmmm, oh really?" 

         "Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter." [Note: You 
don't seem to be able to order] 

         "Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there 
all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore!" 
  
         "HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look!" 

         "You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout 
how things look." 

People outside the Honey Bee Inn 

Johnny 
         "Man... Should I go.... or not?" 
         "I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!" 
         "Hey!! Aren't you...?" 
         "What!! You mean, you're.... too?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, me too. 
         Don't bring me down to your level 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, me too. 

Johnny 
         "You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a girlfriend 
to a place like this!?" 
         "What kind of guy are you!!" 

***Cloud 
         Don't bring me down to your level 

Johnny 
         "What... Me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My 
last memories of Midgar... you know." 
         "But... That guy over there kinda scares me." 
<//> 

         "What the hell!! You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy 
right now!!" 
         "I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!" 

         "Urrgh... no way... I can't go on." 
         "Things aren't working out." 
         "Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it." 

         "Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet your 
destiny here!!" 
         "You looking for a girlfriend too?" 

<CHOICE> 
         You know a girl named Tifa? 
         This place doesn't interest me. 

***Cloud 
         You know a girl named Tifa? 

         "Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl." 
         "But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now." 
         "Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls 
to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion." 
         "Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down 
and is in the market for a bride." 

***Cloud 
         This place doesn't interest me. 

         "Hmm... Seems to like it just fine. Good for you." 
<//> 

         "The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. 
Shoo, shoo." 
  
(Cloud and Aerith meet the doorman outside of Don Corneo's mansion.) 

[Note: The whole scene of getting into Don Corneo's mansion is very 
open-ended. Your results may vary. I have included all the dialogue you 
could encounter while getting the various items, as well as what happens 
when you reach the Don's mansion with different amounts of the items. 
Remember that it is NOT required to get all of the items, and no matter 
how feminine you get, it will not have any bearing on the progression of 
events through the game.] 

         "This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in 
Wall Market." 
         "Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around 
here again..." 
         "Hey, and you got another cute one with you!" 

(Aerith pulls Cloud aside.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look." 
         "I'll tell Tifa about you." 

Cloud 
         "No!! You can't!!" 

Aerith 
         "Why?" 

Cloud 
         "You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?" 

Aerith 
         "Then, what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?" 

Cloud 
         "Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in 
there, it'll cause too much commotion." 

(Aerith is giggling.) 

Cloud 
         "But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......" 
         "First, we'll need to find out if Tifa's alright...." 
         "What's so funny, Aerith?" 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way." 

Cloud 
         "WHAT!?" 

(Aerith speaks to the doorman.) 

Aerith 
         "Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring." 

Cloud 
         "Aerith! I can't....." 

Aerith 
         "You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!" 

[Sequence of events follows, in which Cloud gets various feminine items.] 

(They go to the dress shop and speak to the clerk.) 

Aerith 
         "Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress." 

         "Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?" 

Aerith 
         "What's the problem?" 

         "Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You 
see, he makes all the dresses." 

Aerith 
         "And, where is your father?" 

         "He's probably plastered at the bar." 

Aerith 
         "So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something 
about your father?" 

         "Yes. I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble." 
         "!" 
         "You'd help me bring him back?" 

Aerith 
         "Well, if don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?" 

         "Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what 
to do anymore...." 

Aerith 
         "All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!" 

(They head to the bar and speak to a man seated at the bar.) 

Aerith 
         "Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?" 

         "I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father." 

Aerith 
         "I didn't say that...." 

Cloud 
         "Make me some clothes." 

         "I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' 
anything right now." 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to 
him." 
         "Why don't you go over there and have something to drink." 

(He does so.) 

Aerith 
         "You know, mister." 
         "He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up as a girl." 
         "So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him..." 

         "What!? A tough lookin guy like that?" 

Aerith 
         "So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?" 

         "...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just 
makin' regular clothes." 

Aerith 
         "Then you'll do it for us?" 

         "Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?" 

Aerith 
         "Something..." 

(You get to choose what kind of dress you get here. If you make these 
choices, you will get the Silk Dress, the sexiest dress. Any other 
combination will get you a non-sexy dress.) 

         That feels soft 

Aerith 
         "And something...." 

         that shimmers 

         "Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste 
as him. I'll go talk to him." 

(They return to the Dress Shop and speak to the owner.) 

         "Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on." 

(They receive the Silk Dress. Cloud looks like he is dreading this. He 
steps into the dressing booth and we hear scuffling sounds.) 

Cloud 
         "How... do you put this thing on?" 

(Aerith looks inside.) 

Cloud 
         "Whoa! What are you doing!" 

Aerith 
         "It's still not right. A wig! That's what you need!" 

(She speaks to the owner.) 

         "Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about 
getting one." 
         "You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. 
Go and talk to them." 

(Cloud comes out of the dressing booth, in his normal clothes.) 

Cloud 
         "...'like you'? Aerith, what did you tell him?" 

Aerith 
         "Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!" 

(They travel to the gym and speak to the man watching the squat-thrust 
match. We can only assume it is a man; he appears to be wearing women's 
clothes.) 

         "You the one.... Who wants to be cute?" 

Cloud 
         "Cute?" 

Aerith 
         "Right." 
         "And about the wig..." 

         "Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya." 

(A guy stops working out and comes over.) 

         "Urrrrgh!!!" 
         "Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can 
beat the Big Bro!!" 

(The people doing squat thrusts jump out of the ring.) 

         "That's right!" 
         "So, you've got to compete with us!" 

         "You're right. Let's do squats." 

         "All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!" 

Cloud 
         "Are you...?" 

Aerith 
         "THE beautiful Bro?" 

(The "Beautful" Bro speaks.) 

         "What? You didn't know? Always running around here saying 
Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that...." 
         "Never mind that, come over here." 

(The squat thruster steps forward.) 

         "No. I'll explain the rules." 
         "From the ready position, push Square button to squat, push X 
Button to get up, and push O Button to go back to the ready position." 
         "So it's Square Button, X Button, O Button in that order." 
         "Got it?" 

***Cloud 
         Got it 

         "Whoever has the most squats at the end of 30 seconds gets the 
wig." 
         "I'm not going to lose." 
         "Big Bro's wig is MINE!!" 
         "Just be quiet..." 
         "It's not fair for you to start right away. So, you want 
practice?" 

***Cloud 
         A little 

         "Then, start practicing!" 

(Cloud does squats for 30 seconds.) 

         "You had 20 squats." 
         "Now let's begin the real thing. Start!" 

(Cloud and Work-Out Boy do squats for 30 seconds.) 

         "He had 17 squats and you had 20 squats." 

[Your results may vary] 

         "You're really something. Okay, I'm a man of my word, here 
you are." 

(He gives Cloud the Blonde Wig- the sexiest wig.) 

Big Bro 
         'I'm so mad I'm so so so--- mad!" 

(Beautiful Bro punches him across the room.) 

         "Shut up! Don't cry just because you lost!" 

         "Uuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone!" 

(Everyone administers first aid to Big Bro.) 

[These are the only two events you need to do. The rest are optional.] 

(Cloud and Aerith go to the Materia shop and speak to the owner.) 

         "Hey man. Got a minute? I need to talk... man to man." 

***Cloud 
         What is it 

         "Really! I really appreciate it." 
         "......I'm sorry but, young lady? Would you turn the other way, 
for a second?" 

Aerith 
         "Why.....?" 

Cloud 
         "......Aerith." 

Aerith 
         "Gosh!" 

(She turns.) 

         "I'm sorry, lady." 
         "Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the 
inn?" 
         "I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't 
ask a girl to go get it." 
         "What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, 
I got in a fight with the guy at the inn and can't go there anymore. 
Come on, so how 'bout it?" 

***Cloud 
         I'll go 

         "Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done." 

Aerith 
         "Finished?" 

(They go to the inn and get a room there. Late that night, Cloud gets out 
of bed and goes to the vending machine in the hallway.) 

Cloud 
         "He means this?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't buy it 
         Buy the one for 200 Gil (-) 
         Buy the one for 100 Gil 
         Buy the one for 50 Gil 
<//>

(He drops in the money. The next morning they go back to the Materia shop) 

Cloud 
         "I got it." 

         "Oh, really!! Hey!" 

Aerith 
         "Geez." 

(She turns.) 

         "And, what was it?" 

(Cloud hands it to him.) 

         "A protein drink set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more 
business than him, his head'll spin."

         "Thanks, bud. I'm motivated now. Take this, it's not much..." 

(He gives Cloud a Diamond Tiara.) 

[Buying a cheaper ??? at the Inn will result in a non-sexy Tiara] 

(Cloud and Aerith go to the Honeybee Inn. A guy on the path there 
gives them a members Card. They speak to the bouncer.) 

         "Hey! Is that a 'Member's Card' I see shining in your hot 
little hand?" 
         "Please, come in." 

(Aerith waits outside. All the men around the Inn grovel to her...) 

Cloud 
         "...Hmm. That's how you'll fool them." 

Aerith 
         "......Hmmmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them." 

Cloud 
         "Let's go!!" 

(He goes inside. A girl comes up to him.) 

         "Poo, I uh, mean, Sir..." 
         "Hurry..." 
         "Please choose a room. (Gosh, he's so weird... but then again, 
they all are.)" 

(Cloud ducks into the dressing room for the Honeybees and speaks to them. 
Repeatedly.) 

         "Hmm, hmm, hmm....." 
         "Ohhh, I just can't seem to lose weight. Hmm, hmm, hmm..." 
         "Sir!! You can't come in here." 
         "(Yuk..... a pervert...)" 

         "Eyaah!" 
         "Don't!" 

         "Paste, paste, paste....." 
         "(Oh God... here's another one of those guys. You know, the 
delicate type. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)" 
         "Fluff, fluff, fluff..." 
         "(Hmm! I guess he doesn't realize his position. I feel sorry for 
him. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)" 
         "Pita, pita, pita...." 
         "(God, what a pest! All right, get out of here! You dog...)" 
         "(That's it, I'll name him 'pooch'.)" 
         "Mix, mix, mix...." 
         "(What should I do... Is he following me? Really? What if he 
follows me home...?)" 
         "(Poochy'll do it, I'm sure of it...)" 
         "Shake, shake, shake..."

some occupied doors. Behind the first one, The Lovers Room....)

get comfortable."

City."

walks forward and sees a ghost of himself, transparent, kneeling by the 
tub. The ghost rises and walks to him.) 

Cloud

         "What are you doing in a place like this?"

         "That's what I want to ask you. Should you be foolin' around 
here?" 
         "You think problems will go away just thinkin' about them?"

Cloud's body. He falls and the screen goes black)

the head. Cloud sits up and Mukki flops down on the bed.)

Aerith

Scene 17
- Rescue Tifa From Don Of The Slums -

(They go to the Don's mansion and speak to the doorman.) 

         "Damn!! Your friend's hot, too!" 
         "Come in, come in!!" 
         "Two ladies coming through!" 

(They enter the mansion. A receptionist speaks to them.) 

         "Hey, ladies." 
         "I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go 
wandering around..." 

Aerith 
         "Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa." 

(Cloud goes upstairs and through a door. He comes out in a torture chamber. 
Aerith follows. They see Tifa there, dressed like... .. a slut, to be blunt 
about it.) 

Aerith 
         "...Tifa?" 
         "Nice to meet you. I'm Aerith." 
         "Cloud's told me a lot about you." 

Tifa 
         "...And you are?" 
         "Hey you're the one with Cloud in
the park..." 

Aerith 
         "Right, with Cloud." 

Tifa 
         "Oh....." 

Aerith 
         "Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing." 

Tifa 
         "What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?" 
         "No, don't misunderstand." 
         "Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more." 

Aerith 
         "Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call 
him nothing." 

(She turns to Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "Right, Cloud?" 

Tifa 
         "Cloud?" 

(She checks him out.) 

Tifa 
         "????" 
         "Cloud!?" 
         "Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?" 
         "Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you 
hurt!?" 

Cloud 
         "Hey, give me a chance to explain." 
         "I'm dressed like this... because there was no other way to get 
in here." 
         "I'm all right. Aerith helped me out." 

Tifa 
         "Oh, Aerith did..." 

Cloud 
         "Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?" 

Tifa 
         "Yeah, ummmm...." 

Aerith 
         "Ahem! I'll just plug my ears." 

(She walks to the other side of the room and does so.) 

Tifa 
         "I'm glad you're OK." 

Cloud 
         "Thanks. What happened?" 

Tifa 
         "When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird 
man." 
         "So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him." 

Cloud 
         "That's when the Don's name popped up." 

Tifa 
         "Right, Don Corneo." 
         "Barret told me to leave the lech alone..." 
         "But something's been bothering me." 

Cloud 
         "I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's 
mouth." 

Tifa 
         "So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind." 
         "Corneo is looking for a bride." 
         "Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then.... 
...and, well....." 
         "Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight." 

(Aerith turns.) 

Aerith 
         "Sorry... but I overheard..." 
         "If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?" 

Tifa 
         "I guess so, but..." 

Aerith 
         "We have two here, right?" 

Cloud 
         "No, Aerith! I can't have you get involved." 

Aerith 
         "Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?" 

Cloud 
         "No, I don't want Tifa in...." 

(Tifa walks to Aerith.) 

Tifa 
         "Is it all right?" 

(They start to walk out of the room together.) 

Aerith 
        "I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger." 

(She turns to Tifa.) 

Aerith 
         "Do you trust me?" 

Tifa 
         "Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aerith." 

Aerith 
         "Call me Aerith." 

(A voice from upstairs.) 

         "He---y!!" 

(The receptionist is at the top of the stairs.) 

         "It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!" 

(He goes back upstairs.) 

         "I told ya not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays..." 
         "Hurry up, will ya!" 

Cloud 
         "I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is..." 
         "Me...... right?" 

Tifa 
         You're right, there was no need..." 

(She faces Aerith.) 

Aerith 
         "...to ask." 

(They all go upstairs to the Don's room.....) 
  
  

(Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa enter the Don's room. He is seated at a desk, 
with a flunky on either side.) 

Kotch 
         "All right, ladies!" 
         "Line up in front of the Don!" 

(They line up in a row.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Hmmm! Good, splendid!" 

(He jumps over his desk and checks out
Aerith.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Now, let's see... Which girl
should I choose? Hmm--- hmm---!" 

(He checks out Cloud, who tries to face
away.) 

Don Corneo 
         "This one?" 

(He checks out Tifa.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Or this one?" 

(He checks out Cloud again.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!" 
         "My choice for tonight is....." 

(Drum rollllllllll....)

items you have)

[If you have a fair amount of feminine items] 

(Don Corneo picks Aerith.) 

Don Corneo 
         "This slender little girl!" 

(Aerith nods.) 

Aerith 
         "Don, you've got great taste." 

[If you have ALL the feminine items...] 

(Don Corneo picks Cloud...) 

Don Corneo 
         "This healthy-looking girl!" 

Cloud 
         "Wa, wait a sec! I mean, uh, please wait a moment!" 

Don Corneo 
         "Woo-hoo!" 
         "I love chickies who play hard to get! Yeowza!" 

<//> 

(Don turns to his flunkies.) 

Don Corneo 
         "You can have the other ones!" 

         "Yes, sir! Thank you sir!" 

(He turns to the girl he chose.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Well then, shall we go my pretty?" 

(He leads the girl he chose into the bedroom...)

         "This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!" 

         "Heey!! Three cheers for Don Corneo!" 

Scotch 
         "Heh, heh.... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?" 

(They all start chasing Cloud, who goes up to Scotch.) 

Scotch 
         "Hey... what's wrong? Want me to keep you company?" 

Cloud 
         "No... I'm flattered, but no thanks." 
         "Because..." 

Scotch 
         "Because...?" 

Cloud 
         "Because..." 
         "I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!" 

(He flings off his woman's clothes.)

Knock the crap out of him!!"

(They run to the bedroom.) 

[If Tifa was picked] 

(Cloud is about to go in to the Don's room when Aerith screams from the 
torture chamber.) 

Aerith 
         "No--!! Help!!" 

(Cloud rushes down the stairs.) 

Aerith 
         "No-!!" 

Kotch 
         "Ha ha ha... Wait, you!" 

(Cloud looks down. Kotch is comically chasing Aerith around in circles. 
Aerith runs up the stairs and Kotch follows. When Aerith reaches Cloud, 
she kicks Kotch in the crotch.) 

Aerith 
         "I'm so sorry!" 

(Kotch loses his balance and flails his arms...) 

Kotch 
         "oh, oh, oh...."

Scene 19
- Ecchi Don -

(Don Corneo and the girl he chose are sitting in his extravagantly and 
tastelessly decorated bedroom. It smacks of 'Love Hotel'.) 

[If Tifa was picked] 

Don Corneo 
         "Woo-hoo!" 
         "Come, come, don't be so shy..." 

Tifa 
         "I know...." 
         "But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something 
before we start..." 

Don Corneo 
         "Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?" 
         "Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?" 

(He gets up and, um, wiggles his hips...) 

Tifa 
         "No... I'm not asking about that......" 
         "Wa... wait a minute! No, not yet!!" 

(He, uhm, wiggles again...) 

Don Corneo

         "Aooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!" 

(Cloud and Aerith break in.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!!" 

(Don does a belly flop at Tifa. She hops out of the way, and Don comes 
down face first.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Wha... what the hell? Who goes there?" 

Tifa 
         "You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?" 

(She takes off her dress. No, she's got her normal clothes on under it.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Get what?"

Don Corneo 
         "Woo-hoo!" 
         "Come, come, don't be so shy..." 

Aerith

         "But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first..." 

Don Corneo 
         "Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by 
step. So come on!" 

(He gets up and, uh, wiggles his hips...) 

Aerith 
         "No, that's not what I meant!" 
         "NO, STOP! Just, wait a second!!"

Don Corneo 
         "Ahh, we're finally alone..." 
         "All right, pussycat... Come to daddy!" 

(Cloud reluctantly comes to the bed...) 

Don Corneo 
         "You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you." 
         "Do you like me, too?"

         "No way!" 
         "Hmm? Barret? That sounds familiar..." 

Cloud 
         "You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out 
about. You know, AVALANCHE...?" 

Don Corneo 
         "Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7 in the slum..."

***Cloud 
         Nope, can't do that.... 

Don Corneo 
         "Why? WHY? WHY?" 

(Cloud faces away.) 

Cloud

(He turns toward Don.) 

Cloud 
         "Because I'm gonna have to use that mouth of yours to give me 
some information!!"

Scene 20
- I'll Smash Them - 

(Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith are in Don Corneo's bedroom) 

Tifa 
         "Shut up, we're asking the questions now..." 
         "What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell 
us..." 

(Cloud puts a foot up on the bed.) 

Cloud 
         "...I'll chop them off." 

(Don jumps.) 

Don Corneo 
         "No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!" 

Tifa 
         "So... talk." 

Don Corneo 
         "...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But 
that's what I was ordered to do." 

Tifa 
         "By who?" 

Don Corneo 
         "No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!" 

Tifa 
         "Talk! If you don't tell us..." 

(Aerith puts her foot up on the bed.) 

Aerith 
         "...I'll rip them off." 

Don Corneo 
         "Waaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!" 
         "Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!" 

Cloud 
         "The head of Public Safety Maintenance?" 

Tifa 
         "Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!" 
         "If you don't tell us..." 

(Tifa puts her foot up on the bed.) 

Tifa 
         "I'll smash them." 

Don Corneo 
         "...You're serious, aren't you.... ...ohboy, ohboy, ohboy." 
         "... I'm not fooling around here either, you know." 
         "Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, 
and want to infiltrate their hideout." 
         "And they're really going to crush them... literally." 
         "By breaking the support holding up the plate above them." 

(Tifa steps back.) 

Tifa 
         "Break the support!?" 

Don Corneo 
         "You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING" 
         "and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the 
Sector 7 Slums..." 
         "I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6." 

Tifa 
         "They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?" 

(She turns to Cloud.) 
  
Tifa 
         "Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?" 

Cloud 
         "Of course, Tifa." 

(They all stand at the foot of the bed.) 

Don Corneo 
         "Just a second!" 

Cloud 
         "Shut up!" 

Don Corneo 
         "No wait, it'll only take a second." 
         "How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the 
truth?" 

<CHOICE> 
         They've pretty much given up on life 
         They're sure they'll win 
         They don't know what the hell's going on 

***Cloud 
         They've pretty much given up on life 

Don Corneo 
         "Buuzzzzz! Wrong!" 

***Cloud 
         They're sure they'll win 

Don Corneo 
         "Woo-hoo! Right!" 

***Cloud 
         They don't know what the hell's going on 

Don Corneo 
         "Close, but no cigar!" 
<//> 

(He flips a switch and Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa fall through a trap door to 
the sewer below...) 







Scene 21
- Shinra Plans -

(Heidegger approaches President Shinra's desk in the Shinra building. 
Reeve stands by the desk.) 

President Shinra 
         "How are the preparations going?" 

Heidegger 
         "Ha, ha, ha!! Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to 
this." 

Reeve 
         "President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a 
group with only a few members..." 

President Shinra 
         "What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?" 

(He gets up from his desk and walks around to the front, by Reeve.) 

Reeve 
         "...No." 
         "But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been 
involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why..." 

Heidegger 
         "Reeve, you should flush those personal problems in the morning!" 

Reeve 
         "The Mayor's against this anyway...." 

(Heidegger shrugs.) 

Heidegger 
         "Mayor?" 
         "He just sits in his building all day feeding his face! You 
still call that a Mayor?" 

(He faces the President and salutes.) 

Heidegger 
         "Now if you'll excuse me sir!" 

(He leaves. Reeve follows after him a few steps, then stops, his arm 
outstretched.) 

President Shinra 
         "You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go 
somewhere." 

(Reeve exits.) 

President Shinra 
         "We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then 
we'll send in the rescue operation care of Shinra, Inc... Heh, heh, heh... 
this is perfect." 



  
  



Scene 22
- Encounter At The Reactor Tower -

(Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith fall down a chute, landing in a sewer. Cloud gets 
up and walks over to Aerith.)

Cloud 
         "You alright?" 

(Aerith stands up.) 

Aerith 
         "Yeah." 

(He walks over to Tifa.) 

Cloud 
         "You alright?" 

Tifa 
         "Man! This is terrible." 

Aerith 
         "Well, the worst is over..." 

(They hear a loud rumbling. Cloud looks around...) 

Aerith 
         "Maybe not..." 

(Boss battle with Aps) 

Tifa 
         "It's too late..... Marlene... Barret... the people of the slums." 

Aerith 
         "Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the 
pillar, right?" 

Tifa 
         "......Yeah..... you're right! We still have time." 

(They work their way out of the sewer, arriving at the Train Graveyard, a 
vast wasteland of broken trains and rubble.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith. I got you mixed up in all of this..." 

Aerith 
         "Don't tell me to go home." 

(Tifa looks around.) 

Tifa 
         "Let's see... If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, 
we should be able to get out of here." 

(They climb over and through the trains in the Graveyard until they reach 
the Reactor Tower. Several people are milling around the base of it, and 
we hear noises of shooting from above.) 

Tifa 
         "We made it! The pillar's
standing!" 

Cloud 
         "Wait! You hear something.... above us?" 

Aerith 
         ".....gun fire?" 

(The camera shifts to show the tower, slowly panning upward, until we see 
the top of the tower. Guns are blazing. At the top, we see a flash of 
gunfire, then someone falls twenty stories down to land at the base of the 
tower. It's Wedge. Cloud dashes over and kneels by him.) 

Cloud 
         "Wedge!! You all right!?" 

Wedge 
         ".......Cloud...... You remembered..... my name." 
         "Barret's up top. ...help him......." 
         "An' Cloud.... Sorry, I wasn't any help." 

(Cloud, after a silent pause, stands.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm going up!" 
         "Aerith! You look after Wedge." 

(Tifa walks to Aerith.) 

Tifa 
         "Aerith, do me a favor." 
         "I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood." 
         "There's a little girl named Marlene there......" 

(Aerith nods.) 

Aerith 
         "Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe." 

Tifa 
         "It's dangerous here!" 
         "Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!" 
         "Everyone get out of Sector 7!" 

(They all scatter. Cloud and Tifa climb the tower.) 

People by the tower 

         "L, look... This is my job, so I have to be here until the 
absolute last minute." 
         "Umm.... I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here 
with you." 

         "Uhh..... Help! My strange and wonderful little place." 

         "Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!" 
         "I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great..... I'm 
quitting tomorrow!" 

         "Uh oh..... There goes the pillar." 
         "I'm scared, but it's for you own good." (sells items) 
         "If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll 
see happen very often." 

Aerith 
         "Don't worry, you let me handle this." 
  



Scene 23
- Sector 7 Falls -

(Cloud and Tifa climb the flights of stairs up the side of the tower. 
Along the way, they meet Biggs, who is leaning over the railing, wounded.) 

Biggs 
         "Cloud... so you don't care... what happens... to the.... Planet?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Nope, not interested 
         You're wounded..... 

***Cloud 
         Nope, not interested 

Biggs 
         "Hmph.... you haven't changed. Oh, forget it." 

***Cloud 
         You're wounded..... 

Biggs 
         "Thanks, Cloud." 
         "...don't worry 'bout me.... Barret's... fighting up there. Go 
help him...." 
<//> 

(Continuing up the tower, they meet Jessie, who is lying on the stairs, 
also hurt.) 

Jessie 
         "....Cloud... I'm glad.... I could talk with you one last time." 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't say 'last'....... 
         Is that so..... 

***Cloud 
         Don't say 'last'...... 

Jessie 
         "That's.... all right......" 
         "Because of our actions... many....... people died...... this 
probably.... is our punishment....." 

***Cloud 
         Is that so.... 

Jessie 
         "...Is.. that so......?" 
         "Ha...... cool...... as usual... ex-SOLDIER. ...always... I liked 
that.... in you...." 
<//> 

(Reaching the top of the tower, they meet Barret, who is fighting the 
numberous Shinra enemies.) 

Barret 
         "Tifa! Cloud! You came!" 
         "Be careful! They're attacking
from the helicopter." 

Tifa 
         "Better equip ourselves before
they attack in full force!" 

(They equip themselves) 

Tifa 
         "Here they come!" 

(A helicopter flies past, and Reno drops from it. He runs over to a 
mechanism on the side of the pillar and presses a few buttons on it. 
Cloud, Barret, and Tifa run over.) 

Reno 
         "You're too late. Once I push this button..." 

(Beep.) 

Reno 
         "That's all, folks! Mission accomplished." 

Tifa 
         "We have to disarm it! Cloud! Barret! Please!" 

Reno 
         "I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of Reno and the 
Turks..." 

(Boss battle with Reno) 

Reno 
         "It's time." 

(Reno jumps off the edge of the tower. Tifa runs over to the mechanism and 
tries to disarm the bomb.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud! I don't know how to stop this! Try it!" 

(Cloud examines it.) 

Cloud 
         "It's not a normal time bomb." 

(The helicopter hovers up to the side of the tower. A Turk, Tseng, pops 
his head out the side window.) 

Tseng 
         "That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one." 
         "It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it." 

Tifa 
         "Please, stop it!" 

Tseng 
         "Ha ha ha....." 
         "Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate 
Release System." 

Barret 
         "Shut yer hole!" 

(He fires on the helicopter.) 

Tseng 
         "I wouldn't try that.... You just might make me injure our 
special guest." 

(A woman in a pink dress raises her head up in the window.) 

Tifa 
         "Aerith!!" 

Tseng 
         "Oh, you know each other?" 
         "How nice you could see each other one last time. You should 
thank me." 

Cloud 
         "What are you gonna do with Aerith?" 

Tseng 
         "I haven't decided." 
         "Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient." 
         "It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to 
the President." 

(Aerith leans over the side of the helicopter.) 

Aerith 
         "Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!" 

(Tseng slaps her back into the helicopter. Hard.) 

Tifa 
         "Aerith!" 

(She leans back out.) 

Aerith 
         "Hurry and get out!" 

Tseng 
         "Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think 
you can escape in time?" 

(FMV sequence. The helicopter flies away, and the pillar begins to 
explode, sending chunks of flaming steel and concrete falling to the 
ground.) 

Tifa 
         "Once that plate starts coming
down it's too late. We gotta hurry!" 

(Barret hops up on the railing of the tower and grabs a hanging wire.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, we can use this wire to get out!"


(Tifa climbs in Barret's lap. Cloud climbs up on his shoulders. FMV 
sequence. The pillar explodes. The people in the slums panic as the upper 
plate comes crashing down to crush their homes. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret 
swing on the wire and barely escape the falling plate as President Shinra 
watches it all from his office window in Shinra HQ, opera music blaring 
from the stereo.)   

  
  
  
  



Scene 24
- Biggs... Wedge... Jessie... ...Marlene... -

(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret come to in the playground. Everything has been 
demolished; shards of debris protrude grotesquely from the happy face of 
the children's slide; steam rises from the ground in several places. 
Barret runs over to the pile of debris that was the gate to Sector 7.) 

Barret 
         "Marlene!!" 
         "MAR---LE---NE!!" 

(He runs to one side.) 

Barret 
         "Biggs!" 

(He runs to the other side.) 

Barret 
         "Wedge!!" 

(He runs back to the center.) 

Barret 
         "Jessie!" 

(He punches the debris repeatedly.) 

Barret 
         "GOD DAMN IT!!" 
         "DAMMIT!!" 
         "DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!" 

(He stops; his shoulders are hitching.) 

Barret 
         "What the hell's it all for!?" 
         "ARGGHHHH!!!" 

Cloud 
         "Hey, Barret!" 

Tifa 
         "Barret!" 

Barret 
         "ARGGHHHH!!!" 

(Cloud and Tifa run up to him.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey!" 

Tifa 
         "Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret." 

Barret 
         "URGHHHH!!!" 

(He fires on the pile of debris, sweeping it with bullets... then stops, 
and falls to his knees.) 

Barret 
         "God damn..." 

(He punches the ground. The scene fades.) 
  
(The scene fades back in. Barret is sitting on the end of the slide. Cloud 
and Tifa stand nearby.) 

Barret 
         "Marlene..." 

Tifa 
         "....... Barret......?" 
         "Marlene is.... I think Marlene is safe." 

(Barret looks up.) 

Barret 
         "....huh?" 

Tifa 
         "Right before they took Aerith, she said, 'Don't worry, she's all 
right.' She was probably talking about Marlene." 

(Barret stands.) 

Barret 
         "R, really!?" 

Tifa 
         "But..." 

Barret 
         "Biggs...... Wedge.... Jessie......" 

Cloud 
         "All three of them were in the pillar." 

Barret 
         "Think I don't know that?" 

(He turns, not facing either of them.) 

Barret 
         "But... we, all of us fought together." 

(He sits on the slide again.) 

Barret 
         "I don't wanna think of them as dead!" 

Tifa 
         "And the other people in Sector 7." 

Barret 
         "This is all screwed up!" 
         "They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed 
so many people...." 

Tifa 
         "...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? I
nnocent people lost their lives because of us?" 

(He stands up and shakes his head.) 

Barret 
         "No, Tifa!" 
         "That ain't it! Hell no!!" 
         "It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but 
the Shinra!" 

(Cloud steps back, facing away from Barret and Tifa. Barret faces away 
and raises his arms.) 

Barret 
         "They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to..." 
         "build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!" 
         "If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet!" 

(He turns around.) 

Barret 
         "Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!" 

(Tifa shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "............I don't know." 

Barret 
         "What don't you know!? You don't believe me?" 

Tifa 
         "It's not that. I'm not sure about ... me. My feelings." 

(Barret faces Cloud, whose back is still turned.) 

Barret 
         "An' what about you?" 

(Cloud looks up, still not turning.) 

Cloud 
         "..........." 

(He leaves the playground.) 

Barret 
         "Yo!" 
         "Where's he think he's goin'?" 

Tifa 
         "Oh! Aerith!" 

Barret 
         "Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?" 

Tifa 
         "...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene 
with." 

Barret 
         "Damn! Marlene!!" 

(Barret runs to the exit of the playground, then stops and turns.) 

Barret 
         "Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now." 

(He exits. Tifa heads for the exit, stops and looks back over her 
shoulder... then exits. The scene fades.) 

(The scene fades back in. Cloud is walking along the broken highway, away 
from the playground.) 

         "Cloud!" 

(He turns to see Barret and Tifa run up.) 

Barret 
         "Take me to Marlene!" 

Tifa 
         "You're going to help Aerith?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah.... But before that, there's something I want to know." 

Tifa 
         "What's that?" 

(Cloud takes a step forward.) 

Cloud 
         "It's about the Ancients." 

(The screen flashes white, as if lightning were striking, then goes 
completely black.) 

         In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the 
rightful heirs to this planet! 

(The screen goes white again... then we are back at the broken highway. 
Cloud looks down.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth...?" 

(Cloud falls down. Tifa and Barret run to him.) 

Tifa 
         "Are you all right?" 

Barret 
         "Pull it together, man!" 

(He rises. They all travel to Aerith's house.) 


  
  
  



Scene 25
- The Flower Girl - Origins -

(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa arrive at Aerith's house. Aerith's mother, 
Elmyra, is standing, facing the wall. They walk over to her.) 

Elmyra 
         "Cloud...... wasn't it?" 

(She turns around.) 

Elmyra 
         "It's about Aerith, isn't it?" 

(Cloud bows his head.) 

Cloud 
         "...Sorry. The Shinra have her." 

Elmyra 
         "I know. They took her from here." 

Cloud 
         "They were here?" 

Elmyra 
         "That's what Aerith wanted..." 

Cloud 
         "Why is Shinra after Aerith?" 

(Elmyra faces away.) 

Elmyra 
         "Aerith is an Ancient. The sole survivor." 

Barret 
         "...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?" 

Elmyra 
         "...Not her real mother. Oh... it must have been 15 years ago..." 
         "...during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far 
away place called Wutai." 

(The camera pans up... Aerith's house disappears off the bottom of the 
screen, leaving only black.) 

         "One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he 
was coming home on leave." 

(The screen goes white. A train whistle blows, and we see the Sector 7 
train station. A train is pulling into the station. The door opens, and 
bright light fills the screen. We see various people getting off, greeted 
by their families... Elmyra stands near, watching the people getting 
off... Then the train door closes. She walks, afraid, to the conductor, 
who shakes his head. She sits forlornly on the steps to the platform.) 

         My husband never came back. 
         I wonder if something happened to him? 
         No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled. 
         I went to the station everyday. 
         Then, one day.......... 

(The screen goes white... then we see a woman lying on the steps to the 
platform. A young girl is running around her, crying. Elmyra runs over 
and kneels by the woman. The young girl runs to her.) 

         You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war. 
         Her last words were, "Please take Aerith somewhere safe." 
         My husband never came back. I had no child. I was probably 
lonely. So I decided to take her home with me. 

(A train whistle sounds... the screen goes white, then fades to black.) 

         "Aerith and I became close very quickly. That child loved to 
talk. She used to talk to me about everything." 

(We are back at the living room, but some time past. Aerith as a young 
girl runs down the stairs, then trips on the rug. Elmyra rises from the 
table, helps her up, hugs her, then Aerith scampers out the front door. 
The living room disappears off the top of the screen.) 

         "She told me she escaped form some sort of research laboratory 
somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she 
wasn't lonely... and many other things." 

(We are back at the living room, in the present.) 

Barret 
         "Returned to the planet?" 

Elmyra 
         "I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the 
sky." 
         "But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child 
in many ways." 

Aerith 
         "Mom." 

(Elmyra turns toward the stairs. The camera pans up, hiding Cloud and the 
others, then pans down again and they are gone. Aerith, as a young girl, 
runs down the stairs. Elmyra is speaking in the present.) 

Aerith 
         "Please don't cry." 

Elmyra 
         "Aerith just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her 
if something had happened..." 

Aerith 
         "Someone dear to you has just died." 
         "His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to 
the planet." 

Elmyra 
         "At that time I didn't believe her." 

(The living room disappears off the left side of the screen.) 

Elmyra 
         "But..." 

(It comes back, from the left. Elmyra is sitting at the table, holding 
her head in her hands. Her shoulders are hitching.) 

Elmyra 
         "Several days later... We received a notice saying my husband 
had died..." 

(It disappears to the right.) 

Elmyra 
         "...and that's how it was." 
         "A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day..." 

(The living room reappears from the left. Tseng is in the living room with 
Elmyra.) 

Tseng 
         "We want you to return Aerith to us. We've been saerching for 
her for a long time." 

(Aerith peeks out from behind Elmyra.) 

Aerith 
         "No! Never!" 

Tseng 
         "Aerith, you're a very special child. You are of special blood." 
         "Your real mother was an 'Ancient'." 

Elmyra 
         "Of course I heard it. That she was an Ancient." 

Tseng 
         "The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness." 
         "Aerith will be able to bring happiness to all those in the 
slums." 
         "That is why Shinra would like Aerith's cooperation......." 

(Aerith comes out from behind Elmyra) 

Aerith 
         "He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!" 

Tseng 
         "But Aerith, surely you hear voices
sometimes when you're all alone?" 

Aerith 
         "No, I don't!" 

(Aerith runs out the front door. The
living room disappears off the top right.) 

Elmyra 
         "But I knew. I knew about her
mysterious powers..." 
         "She tried so hard to hide it, so I
acted as though I never noticed." 

(The living room, seen from the top down, comes back into view from the 
top.) 

Cloud 
         "It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years..." 

Elmyra 
         "The Shinra needed her. So I guess they wouldn't harm her." 

Tifa 
         "But, why now....." 

Elmyra 
         "She brought a little girl here with her." 
         "On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get 
away fast enough." 
         "She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little 
girl's safety." 

Cloud 
         "Must be Marlene." 

Barret 
         "Marlene!! Aerith was caught because of Marlene!?" 
         "I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm ...really... sorry..." 

Elmyra 
         "You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a 
child alone like that!?" 

Barret 
         "...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. 
What would happen to Marlene, if I..." 
         "But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. 
I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight." 
         "'Cause if I don't... the planet's gonna die." 
         "So I'm gonna keep fightin'!" 
         "But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with 
her... always." 
         "See? I'm goin' in circles, now." 

Elmyra 
         "I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs 
asleep. Why don't you go and see her." 

(Barret goes upstairs.) 

Tifa 
         "It's my fault... I was the one who got Aerith involved in this." 

Elmyra 
         "Don't say that. Aerith doesn't think that." 

(Cloud goes upstairs, into the bedroom, where Barret is sitting with 
Marlene.) 

Barret 
         "I'm so glad....... I'm so glad you're all right..." 

Marlene 
         "Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!" 

(Cloud leaves the bedroom. Barret stands.) 

Barret 
         "Cloud!" 

(Cloud turns.) 

Barret 
         "You gonna go help Aerith, right? She's done so much for me...." 
         "If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! 
I'm comin', too!" 

(Marlene runs around Barret to Cloud.) 

Marlene 
         "Guess what? Guess what? Aerith was asking me lots of questions." 
         "Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!" 

<CHOICE> 
         I don't know 
         Let's hope so 

***Cloud 
         I don't know 

Marlene 
         "Stupid!" 

***Cloud 
         Let's hope so 

Marlene 
         "I won't tell Tifa." 
<//> 

(Cloud goes to leave.) 

Tifa 
         "You're going after Aerith, right?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah." 

Tifa 
         "I'm going with you." 

Cloud 
         "We're going right into Shinra headquarters. ...You gotta be 
prepared for the worst." 

Tifa 
         "I know." 
         "Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit." 
         "If I stayed here... I'll go crazy." 

(Barret runs downstairs. He speaks to Elmyra.) 

Barret 
         "Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?" 

Elmyra 
         "Yes, I don't mind." 

Barret 
         "This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else." 

Elmyra 
 "...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get 
yourself killed." 

(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret leave Aerith's house and stand in the yard.) 

Tifa 
         "How do we get to the Shinra Building?" 

Barret 
         "There ain't no train that goes up there anymore..." 
         "....." 
         "Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find 
something there." 


  
  
  



Scene 26
- A Golden Shiny Wire Of Hope -

(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret go to Wall Market. They go to the Weapon Shop and 
speak to the old man there.) 

         "You goin' up to the plate? You better have a battery." 

Cloud 
         "You're gonna sell me something you just found?" 

         "Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right." 

Cloud 
         "Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?" 

         "You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for 
each?" 

Cloud 
         "......." 

***Cloud 
         All right, I'll take them 

(He gives you the Batteries.) 

(They continue north. When they reach the Don's mansion, they see two 
children.) 

         "Wanna see something awesome? Follow me!" 

(They follow the children to a large wall. A small girl is sitting at the 
base. There is a power line running up the wall.) 

         "Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary.... Brr." 

Tifa 
         "Can we climb it?" 

         "Yeah. It leads to the Upper World." 

Barret 
         "Awright! We'll climb this wire!" 

Cloud 
         "There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?" 

Barret 
         "There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?" 

Cloud 
         "Just a normal wire." 

Barret 
         "Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope." 

(They peer up the wall.) 

Tifa 
         "You're right. This is the only way to save Aerith..." 

Cloud 
         "Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you 
feel." 
         "Let's go!" 

(They climb the wire..... and climb..... and climb.... when they reach 
the top of the wall they see the two children from earlier, sitting on 
the top.) 

         "Oh man! This is horrible..." 

         "Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing." 

(They climb some more... scaling power lines, broken propellers, and 
pieces of debris, until they reach the top. The Shinra Building.) 




  



Scene 27
- 140 Flights... -

(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa arrive at the foot of the Shinra Building.) 

Barret 
         "Hey, you oughta know this building well." 

Cloud 
         "......Not really, now that I think about it." 
         "This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters." 

Barret 
         "I heard about this place before." 
         "Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to 
even for employees." 
         "Must be where they took Aerith." 
         "The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!" 

(Barret runs toward the door.) 

Tifa 
         "Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through 
the main entrance, are you?" 

Barret 
         "Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra 
butt and......." 

Tifa 
         "That's not going to work! We've got to find another way...." 

Baret 
         "Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, 
Aerith'll....." 

Tifa 
         "I know that! But if we get caught here...." 
         "Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Let's bust on in! 
         Let's sneak in quietly 

***Cloud 
         Let's bust on in 

Barret 
         "That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!" 

(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa bust on in Shinra Headquarters....) 

Receptionist 
         "Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have 
to..." 

Barret 
         "Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency!" 
         "Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta 
the way!!" 

         "Yaagghh!" 

         "Who do they think they are?" 

         "Hey, you don't think that's AVALANCHE?" 

         "Intruders! Sieze them!!" 

(Battle sequence) 

Barret 
         "Let's go to the top!" 

***Cloud 
         Let's sneak in quietly 

Tifa 
         "See? Let's be careful and find a different route!" 

(They go down a side alley and go through a door. Inside, they find... 
stairs.... Lots of them.... They start climbing.) 

Barret 
         "Yo... You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?" 

Tifa 
         "Well we've got to get to Aerith to help her somehow." 

Barret 
         "Talk about out of the way..." 

Tifa 
         "I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!" 

Barret 
         "Y, yo, Tifa! Don't go off alone!" 

(They continue to climb... and climb.... They are climbing stairs 
throughout this whole conversation.) 

Barret 
         "Don't know... why the hell... we gotta climb..." 

Cloud 
         "...because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved 
Aerith." 
         "I doubt that's possible though..." 

Barret 
         "...heh heh heh." 

Cloud 
         "Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps." 

Barret 
         "So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured 
wrong I guess." 

Cloud 
         "Who cares what you figured!" 

Barret 
         "I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong..." 

Tifa 
         "Heh heh heh......." 

Cloud 
         "What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?" 

Barret 
         "How much farther do these stairs go on?" 

Tifa 
         "Why don't you ask them?" 

Barret 
         "It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya 
think?" 

Tifa 
         "Of course not!!" 

Barret 
         "Right... couldn't be that...." 

Barret 
         "Are we there yet?" 

Tifa 
         "Not yet." 

Barret 
         "...there yet?" 

Tifa 
         "I said not yet!" 

Barret 
         "Yo..." 

Tifa 
         "Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being 
there, ok!?" 

Barret 
         "Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!" 

Tifa 
         "And take just as long going down as you did coming up?" 

Barret 
         "............." 

(Barret stops to rest, panting.) 

Tifa 
         "C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!" 

Barret 
         "Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood.... 'cept 
for this arm of mine." 
         "Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or 
somethin'........" 

Tifa 
         "What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm 
going on!" 

(She pauses.) 

Tifa 
         "......?" 
         "Yaah! Barret! You go first!" 

Barret 
         "What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that..." 

Tifa 
         "All right, all right!" 

(Barret goes on.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, you go on ahead too!!" 

(Cloud goes ahead.) 

Barret 
         "Yo... What floor is this?" 

Tifa 
         "...I gave up counting." 

Barret 
         "Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?" 
         "That Shinra.... They're just no damn good." 

Tifa 
         "........." 

Barret 
         "huff.... Man, I'm beat..." 
         "Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time..." 

Tifa 
         "Would you stop acting like a retard and climb?" 
         "It's just a bit more!" 
         "...maybe." 

(They reach the top floor.) 

Barret 
         "F... finally... M... made it..." 
         "N... never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life..." 

Tifa 
         "huff... puff... this really takes it out of you..." 
         "But this is it. We'd better get ready...!" 

(They enter the door at the top of the stairs...)

Scene 28
- Climbing Shinra Tower -

(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret reach the 59th floor of the Shinra building. 
Three guards see them.) 

         "Destroy the intruders!" 

(Battle sequence) 

(Cloud spots a tiny card on the floor where the guards had stood.) 

Cloud 
         "What's this?" 

(He stoops and picks up the Keycard 60. They enter the elevator to the 
60th floor.) 

Barret 
         "This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down." 

Tifa 
         "I hope Aerith is all right." 

(FMV sequence of a guard asleep at the surveillance system. They exit the 
elevator onto the 60th floor. They see two guards.) 

         "People like you don't belong here! Go on, get out!" 
         "What're you doing here!? No unauthorized people are allowed 
here!!" 

(They duck into a side room. They see four guards on patrol.) 

Barret 
         "Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around." 
         "Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come." 

(The guards are patrolling behind a row of statues, for some reason. 
Cloud hides behind each statue, moving forward when the guards look away. 
He signals the others to follow. The PLAYER controls this. If they are 
spotted, they fight a battle and start over. They make their way past the 
guards.) 

Barret 
         "Ok! We gonna rock!" 

Tifa 
         "Remember, we're here to save Aerith." 

Barret 
         "Hell, I know that!" 

(They climb the stairs to the 61st floor. It is an employee lounge.) 

People on the 61st floor 

         "What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?" 
         "Even employees can't walk around above the 60th floor without a 
keycard.." 

         "This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for 
the big wigs in the company." 
         "It's tough working under someone. Tires you out." 

         "I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know 
what that was all about?" 

         "No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th 
floor is safe." 

         "The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Where's Aerith? 
         .......... 

***Cloud 
         Where's Aerith? 

         "Aerith? How did you know that name? You must be...!?" 
         "Aerith, you mean that kid. The receptionist. Yeah, I was 
startin' to worry 'bout her myself." 
         "And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?" 
         "You mean, she's not? It's someone else?" 

***Cloud 
         .......... 

         "Oh, I see. So you must be the whatcha call it..." 
         "Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!" 
         "You know, it looks like this building is starting to fall apart." 
         "This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right 
away." 
         "Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors too. I'll give 
you this." 

(He gives you the Keycard 62.) 
<//> 

         "I don't remember seeing your face here. You new here?" 
         "Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some... things." 

<CHOICE> 
         Things? 
         Um, I'm kinda in a hurry... 

***Cloud 
         Things? 

         "Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach 
you how to get to the next floor." 
         "The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th 
floor. But you can't get there without a keycard." 
         "Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely." 

 *ding* 

         "...voila! You hear that sound and the door opens." 
         "Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard 
won't let you go everywhere." 
         "For example, 
         "'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. 'Keycard 65' 
only takes you to the 65th floor." 
         "It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, all the 
power in Midgar and the world, for that matter, is controlled by them." 
         "Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!" 

***Cloud 
         Um, I'm kinda in a hurry... 

         "Oh? That's too bad..." 

(They go up to the 62nd floor. It's the Mayor's floor. There are four 
rooms, full of bookshelves. Standing outside the Mayor's office is Hart.) 

Hart 
         "How do you do?" 
         "This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his 
office." 
         "I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel 
free to ask me..." 

(They enter the office.) 

Domino 
         "Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?" 
         "You all must be those... ahem.... Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of 
Midgar." 
         "Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it 
is really run by Shinra, Inc." 
         "My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents..." 
         "Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh......." 
         "You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the 
password, I'll give you my keycard." 
         "Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my 
keycard!" 
         "Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!" 

(Now the PLAYER must solve a puzzle.) 

Hart 
         "Did you speak with the Mayor?" 
         "What? A password? Oh, I get it..." 
         "He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really 
blame him. Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra." 
         "Maybe I can help you." 

(Hart will offer help in the puzzle, but it costs money. You won't need 
it, since I'm going to tell you how to solve it!) 

[To solve the puzzle: 
         Look on the nameplates outside each of the four rooms. They will 
tell you what the subject of the rooms are. 
         Enter the room and search the bookshelves until you find a book 
whose title does not match the subject of the room. 
         Look at the number of the book you chose. Now, take the letter of 
the title corresponding to that number. That is, if the number was 3, you 
would take the third letter. 
         Now, look at the four letters from the four rooms, and anagram 
them until they match one of the Mayor's passwords. 
         That's it! If you got it on the first try, you will recieve an 
Elemental Materia.] 

Domino 
         "Got it?" 
         "Then tell me." 

(Cloud tells him the password. This time it was BEST, your results may 
vary - it's random each time, so don't just choose BEST.) 

Domino 
         "BEST!!" 
         "God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best..... ME!! No 
matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it." 
         "......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it." 

(He gives you Keycard 65.) 

Domino 
         "I never thought you'd get it on the first try..." 
         "Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, 
a promise is a promise. Take this, too." 

(He gives you Elemental Materia.) 

Domino 
         "Why would I do something like this, you ask?" 
         "To mess with them, of course! Shinra's been torturing me 
forever." 
         "That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up 
there and really make them suffer." 
         "This ought to make us even! Heh heh heh....." 

(They go to the 63rd floor, a maze of doors and ventilation pipes. They go 
to a computer terminal in the corner.) 

         "... beep....beep.... ......verifying key card..... 
...................." 
         "Level B employee: verified. You are permitted to open doors on 
this floor up to three times." 
         "blip... If you receive an item coupon, remember to exchange it 
for an item." 
         "...warning... refrain from entering the air conditioning ducts 
recklessly - they are very dangerous." 

(They mess around with the doors awhile and enter the ducts, of course, 
until they get the three item coupons. They go back to the terminal.) 

         "...bing... bing... Enter command" 

<CHOICE>

         C coupon.......'All Materia'" 
         "Please use caution... once you have exchanged coupons for items

         "..................... Coupon exchange complete." 

(You get the three items.)

(They go up to the 64th floor, the employee gym.) 

People on the 64th floor 

         "...huff...puff... If you're tired, you should get some rest in 
the next room." 

         "...huff...wheeze... I'm starting to worry about my belly....." 

         "Hmph, hmph... Since I'm head of security for this building, 
stamina's very important to me."

<//> 

[a locker] 
Cloud 
         "What is this..... a Megaphone?" 
         "Hanging on to this won't do any
good..." 

(They go to the 65th floor, where they solve a tedious puzzle. There are 
several treasure chests, but only one is open. You must find the unlocked 
one, get the Midgar Piece from it, and place it in a hole in a large model 
of Midgar. You are being attacked the whole time. If you want the chest 
sequence, it's 2nd from top on left, 3rd from top on left, top right 
corner, top left, bottom left. The Keycard 66 is in the chest by the 
stairs. Cloud examines the model at the far left, where Sector 6 would be.) 

Cloud 
         "Midgar.... born from Mako energy which was sucked right out of 
the earth. A model of the city...." 
         "When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be 
complete." 
         "That must be why he took Aerith...." 

(They go to the 66th floor. A secretary passes them on the way up) 

         "Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files." 
         "But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of 
being a secretary!" 

People on the 66th floor

         "Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some 
sort of stench coming from somewhere...." 

         "Hey, when you're in the bathroom, do you ever hear whispers 
coming from somewhere?" 

         "They're having another executive meeting. I wonder if it's about 
that Plate incident." 

         "It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving 
this world, just with my hands." 

         "Come on, we're building the future of Mako!" 

(They enter the bathroom.) 

<CHOICE> 
         Flush?

         Get out of here 

***Cloud 
         Flush 

(He flushes the toilet.) 

***Cloud 
         Climb up? 

(They climb up into the ventilation duct above the toilet. It leads to 
above the Conference Room, which would explain the smell in there.) 

***Cloud 
         Get out of here 

(They leave the bathroom.) 
<//> 

[In the duct above the Conference Room.....] 

(They crouch above the vent. Through the slats, they see President Shinra 
and other employees sitting at a long table in the Conference Room.) 

Barret 
         "Geez--! That's a lotta suits!" 

(They watch...) 

Reeve 
         "We have the damage estimates for Sector 7." 
         "Considering those factories we already set up and all the 
investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil..." 

(The camera changes; we are now looking at the table head-on.) 

Reeve 
         "The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is..." 

President Shinra 
         "We're not rebuilding." 

Reeve 
         "What?" 

President Shinra 
         "We're leaving Sector 7 as it is." 
         "And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan." 

Reeve 
         "...then the Ancients?" 

President Shinra 
         "The Promised Land will soon be ours." 
         "I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area." 

(Palmer, a fat, bald, guy, jumps up and down.) 

Palmer 
         "Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space 
Program in the budget!" 

President Shinra 
         "Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate 
increase." 

(Palmer sits down.) 

Palmer 
         "Oh man!" 

(We are looking down from above again.) 

Reeve 
         "Sir, if you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence..." 

President Shinra 
         "It'll be all right." 
         "The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust 
Shinra, Inc. even more." 

Heidegger 
         "Ha ha ha!" 
         "After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!" 

Barret 
         "That dirty #$*$^" 

(We are looking at the table head-on again. Hojo enters the Conference 
Room.) 

President Shinra 
         "Hojo. How's the girl?" 

(Hojo turns his head.) 

Hojo 
         "As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the 
process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference 
is 18%." 

President Shinra 
         "How long will the research take?"

Hojo 
         "Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our 
lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter." 

(Hojo turns away from the table.) 

Hojo 
         "That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create 
one that would withstand our research for a long time." 

President Shinra 
         "What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?" 

Hojo 
         "That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has 
her weaknesses." 

(We are looking down from the duct again.) 

President Shinra 
         "That concludes our meeting." 

(The employees dissemble. Scarlet pauses and looks up.) 

Scarlet 
         "Something stinks..." 

(She leaves. Cloud looks up.) 

Cloud 
         "They were talking about Aerith... right?" 

Barret 
         "I dunno." 

Tifa 
         "Probably." 

Cloud 
         "Let's follow 'em." 

(They exit the duct and land back on the toilet. They exit the bathroom 
and come around a corner. They spot Hojo.) 

Cloud 
         "Hojo... huh...?" 

(Hojo climbs the stairs to the 67th floor. They follow.) 




  



Scene 29
- Specimen - Jenova -

(Cloud, Tifa, and Barret follow Hojo to the 67th floor of the Shinra 
building.) 

Barret 
         "I remember him." 
         "That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science 
Department. Cloud, don't you know him?" 

Cloud 
         "This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So... 
that's what he looks like..." 

(They follow Hojo to a dreary laboratory. A red, lionlike creature is 
imprisoned in a glass tube, sitting apathetically in the far corner. 
They hide behind a crate, just in time to avoid an employee who enters 
the room.) 

         "Is this today's specimen?" 

Hojo 
         "Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level." 

(The employee leaves. Hojo places his hand on the glass.) 

Hojo 
         "My precious specimen..." 

(He stands there for a while, then exits. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret come 
out of hiding. Tifa goes to the creature.) 

Tifa 
         "Precious specimen...?" 
         "Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?" 

(Cloud turns. He sees a metal dome, with a single door. There is a 
window in the door, through which shines bright purple light.) 

Cloud 
         "Jenova..."

(He peers into the window and sees a strange, white, female being. Her 
head has apparently been removed rather violently. Cloud backs away and 
clutches his head. A high-pitched whine reverberates through the room, or 
perhaps only Cloud's head, and he collapses to the floor. Tifa and Barret 
run over.) 

Cloud 
         "Jenova... Sephiroth's... So... they've brought it here." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, be strong!" 

Cloud 
         "Did you see it?" 

Barret 
         "See what?" 

Cloud 
         "It's moving........ still alive?" 

(Barret looks into the window.) 

Barret 
         "Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep 
goin'." 

(Cloud gets up. They continue, futher into the lab, reaching an elevator. 
They enter and climb to the 68th floor.) 



  
  



Scene 30
- Experimental Aerith -

(Cloud, Barret, and Tifa arrive on the 68th floor. It is a research lab, 
more advanced than that on the 67th floor. There is a glass tube like 
that on the 67th. Near the glass tube is Hojo. Inside the glass tube is 
Aerith.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith!" 

Hojo 
         "Aerith? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?" 

Cloud 
         "We're taking Aerith back." 

Hojo 
         "Outsiders....." 

Barret 
         "Shoulda noticed it earlier, you..." 

Hojo 
         "There's so many frivolous things in this world." 

(Cloud and Barret move forward.) 

Hojo 
         "Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should." 
         "The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could 
operate it? Hmm?" 

Cloud 
         "Ugh." 

Hojo 
         "That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before 
you make any rash moves." 
         "Now, bring in the Specimen!" 

(The red creature from the 67th floor is lifted into the tube. Cloud, 
Barret, and Tifa run to the tube. The creature twitches its tail. Aerith 
runs to the glass.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, help!" 

(Cloud turns to Hojo.) 

Cloud 
         "What do you think you're doin'?" 

Hojo 
         "Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them 
are on the brink of extinction..." 
         "If I don't help, all these animals will disappear." 

Tifa 
         "...animal? That's terrible! Aerith is a human being!" 

Barret 
         "You're gonna pay!" 

Cloud 
         "Barret! Can't you do anything?" 

(Barret aims his gun at the tube.) 

Barret 
         "Awright!! Step back!" 

Hojo 
         "Stop!" 

(Barret fires at the tube. The inside of the tube glows a brilliant white 
as it malfunctions. Hojo runs to the tube.) 

Hojo 
         "Wh... what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens..." 

(The tube glows brighter. The door opens... the light dims, and we see the 
red creature poised in the door. It leaps forward and starts attacking 
Hojo.) 

Cloud 
         "Now's our chance to get Aerith!" 

(Cloud runs into the tube and helps Aerith up from the floor.) 

Aerith 
         "Thanks, Cloud." 

(She runs out of the tube, which starts to glow a dull blue. Cloud backs 
out of the tube.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... what's wrong?" 

Cloud 
         "...The elevator is moving." 

(Hojo pulls himself out from under the red creature.) 

Hojo 
         "This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!" 

(It turns away from Hojo and sits.) 

         "He's rather strong. I'll help you all out." 

Tifa 
         "It talked!?" 

         "I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss." 

(Cloud runs out of the tube and to the creature.) 

Cloud 
         "We'll take care of that monster." 
         "Somebody take Aerith somewhere safe..." 

<CHOICE> 
         Tifa, I'm countin' on you! 
         Barret, take care of her! 

***Cloud 
         Tifa, I'm countin' on you! 

(Tifa and Aerith run out.) 

***Cloud 
         Barret, take care of her! 

(Barret and Aerith run out.) 
<//> 

Cloud 
         "What's your name?" 

Red 
         "Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever 
to me. Call me whatever you wish." 

(The PLAYER names Red XIII) 

Cloud 
         "Come on!" 

(Boss battle with HO512) 

(Aerith and Tifa/Barret run into the lab.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith, you all right?" 

Tifa 
         "She seems all right, ...in many ways." 

Red XIII 
         "I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things." 

Barret 
         "What are you?" 

Red XIII 
         "An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you 
see." 
         "...You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of 
here. I'll lead the way." 

Aerith 
         "Cloud... so you did come for me." 

(Red XIII leaps over the railing toward the exit.) 

Red XIII 
         "I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to 
throw Hojo off guard......" 

Barret 
         "Now we've saved Aerith, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So 
let's get the hell outta here!" 

Cloud 
         "If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up 
into two groups." 

(You can rearrange your party here. I took Red XIII and Barret.) 

Aerith 
         "I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor 
Elevator." 

Tifa 
         "We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator." 

(They exit. A person in the lab gives them the Keycard 68.) 

         "No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do." 
         "To prove it to you.... here, this is the key card to the 68th 
Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?" 

(They go to the 66th Floor elevator and operate the switch. A Turk walks 
in and places his hand on Cloud's shoulder...) 

Cloud 
         "H, hey! What is it?" 

Rude 
         "Would you press 'Up' please?" 

Cloud 
         "Turks? Must be a trap..." 

(Tseng comes into the elevator.) 

Tseng 
         "It must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?" 

Cloud 
         "Ggh..." 


  
  
  



Scene 31
- Captured - Meet The President -

(Rude and Tseng lead Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Red XIII into the 
President's office. Their hands and feet are bound.) 

Cloud 
         "You all got caught, too?" 

(He turns to the President.) 

Cloud 
         "Where is Aerith!?" 

President Shinra 
         "In a safe place." 

(He gets up from his desk.) 

President Shinra 
         "She's the last surviving Ancient..." 
         "Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived 
thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history." 

Red XIII 
         "Cetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?" 

President Shinra 
         "Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised 
Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her." 

Red XIII 
         "The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?" 

President Shinra 
         "Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue." 
         "It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile." 
         "...If the land is fertile..." 

Barret 
         "Then there's gotta be Mako!" 

President Shinra 
         "Exactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is a 
necessity." 
         "The abundant Mako will just come out on its own." 
         "That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory..." 

(Barret struggles against his handcuffs.) 

Barret 
         "@$#^%! Quit dreamin'!" 

President Shinra 
         "Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your 
dreams to come true is money and science." 
         "Well, that is all for our meeting." 

(Rude hurries in.) 

Rude 
         "Come on! Outta his way!" 

(Cloud, Tifa, and Red XIII leave. Barret stays behind.) 

Barret 
         "Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!" 

(He is dragged out, still struggling, by Rude. President Shinra polishes 
his jacket buttons.) 

President Shinra 
         "If you need something else... talk to my secretary." 
  
  






Scene 32
- A Night In Jail-

(Cloud and the others wake up in the prison cells on the 67th floor. 
Aerith is in her own cell on the left, Barret and Red XIII share the right 
cell, and Tifa is in the cot in Cloud's center cell.) 

Tifa 
         "Psst (Can we get out?)" 

<CHOICE> 
         (Leave it to me) 
         (Kinda hard) 

***Cloud 
         (Leave it to me) 

Tifa 
         "Psst (Cloud, you're so brave!)" 

***Cloud 
         (Kinda hard) 

Tifa 
         "Psst (Don't give up!)" 
<//> 

(Cloud walks to the door of the cell) 

<CHOICE> 
         I wonder how Barret is doing 
         I wonder how Red XIII is doing 
         I wonder how Aerith is doing 

***Cloud 
         I wonder how Barret is doing 

(The camera moves over to show Barret's cell.) 

Barret 
         "Hey!" 
         "Aerith is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is 
Cetra." 
         "The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is 
searching for that Promised Land." 
         "I only hear stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it 
really exists." 
         "Is that right?" 
         "The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako 
energy." 
         "Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the 
Mako energy." 
         "...and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker." 

(He stands.) 

Barret 
         "I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!!" 
         "Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aerith too." 

(He turns to Red XIII) 

Barret 
         "How 'bout you?" 

(Red XIII gets up, stretches, and lies down again.) 

Barret 
         "You're so damn boring." 

***Cloud 
         I wonder how Red XIII is doing 

Red XIII 
         "............Grandpa." 

Barret 
         "Grandpa!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm.... ha, ha, ha......." 

(Red XIII sits up.) 

Red XIII 
         "What's so funny?" 

Barret 
         "Nothin'...... ha, ha" 

***Cloud 
         I wonder how Aerith is doing 

(The camera moves over to show Aerith's cell. She is lying on her cot.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, are you there?" 

Cloud 
         "Aerith!? You safe?" 

Aerith 
         "Yeah, I'm all right." 

(She swings her legs over the side of the cot.) 

Aerith 
         "I knew that Cloud would come for me." 

Cloud 
         "Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?" 

(She walks to the door of her cell.) 

Aerith 
     "The deal was for one date, right?" 

(Tifa sits up.) 

Tifa 
         "............oh, I get it." 

Aerith 
         "...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!" 

Tifa 
         "EXCUSE me." 

(She stands up.) 

Tifa 
         "You know, Aerith, I have a question." 

Aerith 
         "What?" 

Tifa 
         "Does the Promised Land really exist?" 

(Aerith shakes her head.) 

Aerith 
         "...I don't know." 

(She walks to the middle of her cell and looks upwards.) 

Aerith 
         "All I know is..." 
         "The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and 
unlock the Planet." 
         "And....... then......" 
         "The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises 
supreme happiness." 

(She looks back down.) 

Tifa 
         "...What does that mean?" 

Aerith 
         "More than words...... I don't know." 

Cloud 
         "...Speak with the Planet?" 

(Tifa sits back on the cot.) 

Tifa 
         "Just what does the Planet say?" 

Aerith 
         "It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what 
they're saying." 

(A beat.) 

Cloud 
         "You hear it now?" 

Aerith 
         "I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said 
that Midgar was no longer safe. That is.... my real mother." 

(She sits back on the cot.) 

Aerith 
         "Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find 
my Promised Land." 
         "...That's what mom said." 
         "I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but...." 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         Let's just get some sleep 

(Cloud walks to the wall of the cell and sits down.) 


  
  
  



Scene 33
- Sephiroth Alive!? - Rufus' Ascent -

(Cloud wakes up in the middle of the night in his and Tifa's prison cell. 
He sees that the door is open.) 

Cloud 
         "The door's open... When did it open?" 

(He goes through the door and walks down the hall. There is a guard, 
dead, lying on the floor. He kneels by him) 

Cloud 
         "What's happened?" 

(He goes back to Tifa's cell.) 

Cloud 
         "Tifa... Wake up!" 

(Tifa sits up.) 

Tifa 
         "What's wrong?" 

Cloud 
         "Something's wrong. Look outside." 

(She goes out to the guard. Cloud follows.) 

Tifa 
         "I wonder what happened..." 

Cloud 
         "He should have the key on him..." 

(He gets the prison keys.) 

Cloud 
         "Come on, Tifa, get Aerith, I'll go help Barret and the others." 

(Tifa goes to Aerith's cell. Cloud runs to Barret and Red XIII's.) 

Cloud 
         "Barret, Red XIII... come with me. Something's wrong." 

(Barret gets up.) 

Barret 
         "How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?" 

(They run out to the dead guard.) 

Barret 
         "The hell's goin' on!?" 

Red XIII 
         "No human could've done this." 
         "I'll go on ahead." 

(Red XIII goes.) 

Barret 
         "I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get 
caught by Shinra!" 

(Cloud collects Tifa and Aerith.) 

Tifa 
         "Come on, let's follow Red XIII!" 

(They follow Red XIII to the lab where he was previously imprisoned. The 
path there is stained with blood and littered with bodies. Where there 
was a door in the metal dome, there is now a gaping hole.) 

Cloud 
         "...Did it get away? Jenova...?" 

Red XIII 
         "Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using 
that elevator for the specimens." 

(They take the elevator up to the 68th floor. Red XIII is waiting.) 

Red XIII 
         "It looks like it leads up..." 

(They take the elevator up to the 69th floor., then the stairs up to the 
70th. Barret and Red XIII catch up with the rest. They arrive at President 
Shinra's office. He is seated at his desk. A large sword is protruding
from his back.) 

Barret 
         "He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead." 

(Tifa runs around to him.) 

Tifa 
         "Then this sword must be...!?" 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth's!!" 

Tifa 
         "...Sephiroth is alive?" 

Cloud 
         "...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword." 

Barret 
         "Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!" 

         "Uh!" 

(Palmer jumps out from behind the desk and makes a break for it. Cloud 
and Barret catch him by the arms.) 

Palmer 
         "P, p, p, please, don't kill me!" 

Cloud 
         "What happened?" 

Palmer 
         "Se... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came." 

Cloud 
         "Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?" 

Palmer 
         "Yeah, I saw him!! I saw him with my own eyes!" 

Cloud 
         "You really saw him?" 

Palmer 
         "Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his 
voice too!" 
         "Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the 
Promised Land." 

Tifa 
         "Then what?" 
         "Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that 
Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?" 

Barret 
         "So he's a good guy then?" 

Cloud 
         "Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!" 
         "It's not that simple!! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is 
different!" 

(A helicopter hovers into view in the big bay windows. Palmer breaks free 
and flees.) 

Barret 
         "Rufus! &*%$!!  I forgot about him!" 

Tifa 
         "Who's that?" 

Barret 
         "Vice President Rufus. The President's son." 

Tifa 
         "I wonder what kind of person he
is..." 

Aerith 
         "I've heard that no one's ever seen
him bleed or cry." 

Barret 
         "I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long 
time..." 

Red XIII 
         "I only know his name." 

(Cloud runs out onto the balcony at the top of the Shinra Building. The 
rest follow. They find Rufus and Palmer there.) 

Rufus 
         "So... So Sephiroth was actually here. ...By the way." 

(Palmer runs away.) 

Rufus 
         "Who are you guys?" 

(The camera focuses on each person in turn.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!" 

Barret 
         "I'm from AVALANCHE!" 

Tifa 
         "Same here!" 

Aerith 
         "...a flower girl from the slums." 

Red XIII 
         "A research specimen." 

(Rufus shrugs.) 

Rufus 
         "What a crew." 

(He smooths his hair with nonchalance.) 

Rufus 
         "Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc." 

Barret 
         "You only President, 'cause your old man died!" 

Rufus 
         "That's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech." 

(He walks to Tifa.) 

Rufus 
         "...Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to 
have been working." 

(He walks to Aerith.) 

Rufus 
         "The population thought that Shinra would protect them." 

(He walks to Barret.) 

Rufus 
         "Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra 
army will help you." 
         "It looks perfect on the outside." 
         "But, I do things differently." 
         "I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it 
like my old man." 

(He walks to the railing.) 

Rufus 
         "A little fear will control the minds of the common people. 
There's no reason to waste money on them." 

(A pause.) 

Tifa 
         "He likes to make speeches just like his father." 

(Cloud turns.) 

Cloud 
         "Get outta this building with Aerith!" 

Barret 
         "What?" 

Cloud 
         "I'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the 
Planet!" 

Barret 
         "The hell's that supposed to mean?" 

Cloud 
         "I'll tell you later! Just take my word for it! I'll go after 
I take care of him!" 

Barret 
         "Awright, Cloud!" 

(They all head back down to the 69th floor, but Cloud. Aerith pauses 
on the way out.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud... I just thought of something." 

(Tifa goes back to Aerith.) 

Tifa 
         "...I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!" 

(They all head back toward the stairs. Tifa stays in the doorway.) 

Aerith 
         "Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should 
check on our equipment." 

(Aerith, Barret, and Red XIII re-equip themselves and get on the elevator. 
As soon as they press the button to go down, they are attacked.) 

(Boss battle with Hundred Gunner) 



  
  



Scene 34
- A Confrontation With The New President -

(Cloud stands on the balcony on the top floor with Rufus. They face each 
other. Cloud equips himself.) 

Rufus 
         "Why do you want to fight me?" 

Cloud 
         "You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth." 

Rufus 
         "Hm, exactly." 

(He walks to the side of Cloud.) 

Rufus 
         "Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?" 

Cloud 
         "...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or 
Sephiroth have the Promised Land!" 

Rufus 
         "I see. I guess this means we won't become friends." 

(Boss battle with Rufus and Dark Nation) 

Rufus 
         "Heh... That's all for today." 

(Rufus grabs the runner of the helicopter circling overhead and makes a 
spectacular getaway, as is typical of the villain. Cloud runs back down 
to the 69th floor, where he meets up with Tifa.) 

Tifa 
         "Where's Rufus?" 

Cloud 
         "I couldn't finish 'em. Looks like this's gonna get complicated." 



  
  



Scene 35
- A Spectacular Escape - Highway Battle -

(Aerith, Barret, and Red XIII arrive on the bottom floor. They go to the 
main exit.) 

Barret 
         "I'll go on ahead!" 

(Barret goes out, to be met by a hail of gunfire. He ducks back in.) 

Barret 
         "*&^%(*... surrounded, huh?" 
         "If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation 
to protect." 

Aerith 
         "You all get out while you can." 
         "It's not you they're after... it's me." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, well that ain't happenin'." 
         "You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to 
watch out for you!" 

(He turns back to the doorway.) 

Barret 
         "Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses..." 

(Aerith takes a step toward him.) 

Aerith 
         "...thank you, Mr. Barret!" 

(He turns.) 

Barret 
         "Who you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right!" 

Red XIII 
         "Well then..." 
         "If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way 
to get out of here." 

Barret 
         "Huh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like somone else 'round 
here I know." 

Red XIII 
         "Did you say something?" 

Barret 
         "Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?" 

Tifa 
         "Barret!" 

(Tifa comes sprinting down the stairs.) 

Barret 
         "Tifa! Where's Cloud?" 

(Tifa runs over to the side of the room.) 

Tifa 
         "Everyone, over here!" 

Barret 
         "Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?" 

Tifa 
         "I'll tell you later! Hurry, Hurry!!" 

(FMV sequence. The party follows Tifa to a safe distance. Cloud rides a 
motorcycle from the Shinra Showroom down the stairs. The party jumps into 
a pickup truck also from the showroom and follows Cloud; they drive up the 
stairs and crash through a window onto the freeway outside.)

[Here you play a minigame in which you must protect the truck from oncoming 
motorcycles. How well you perform determines how may HP you will have 
when you fight a boss at the end.] 

(Boss battle with Motor Ball) 


  
  
  



Scene 36
- Ahead On Our Way -

(After the battle. The party stands on the freeway. They are at the edge, 
where it must have collapsed some time ago and never rebuilt, only added 
warning lights. The purple mountains of the eastern continent are visible 
in the distance.) 

Barret 
         "Well, what do we do now?" 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth is alive. I... I have to settle the score." 

Barret 
         "And that'll save the Planet?" 

Cloud 
         "...Seems like it." 

Barret 
         "Awright, I'm going." 

Aerith 
         "I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out." 

Cloud 
         "About the Ancients?" 

Aerith 
         ".......Many things." 

Tifa 
         "I guess this's good bye, Midgar." 

(They all climb down a rope hung from the edge of the highway, landing in 
the outskirts of Midgar.) 

Red XIII 
         "I'm going backto my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that." 

Tifa 
         "...I guess this is the start of our journey..." 

<CHOICE> 
         You hate traveling? 
         It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 

***Cloud 
         You hate traveling? 

Tifa 
         "...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I 
guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not." 

***Cloud 
         It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 

Tifa 
         ".....Mmm. but you know, it should be all right if you keep your 
promise." 
<//> 

Aerith 
         "You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar..." 

<CHOICE> 
         Really? ...You worried? 
         It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 

***Cloud 
         Really? ...You worried? 

Aerith 
         "A little,... no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?" 

***Cloud 
         It's dangerous. You sure you want to go? 

Aerith 
         "I thought you'd say that!" 
<//> 

Barret 
         "We told Aerith's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be 
safe too." 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, she should be 
         Hmm, I don't know 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, she should be 

Aerith 
         "She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe 
it's for the best." 

***Cloud 
         Hmm, I don't know 

Aerith 
         "Stop it, Cloud! I'm worried too." 
<//> 

(Cloud heads out, away from Midgar.) 

Cloud 
         "Then..." 

<CHOICE> 
         Let's stay here for a while 
         Let's go! 

***Cloud 
         Let's stay here for a while 

***Cloud 
         Let's go! 

(Barret starts boxing with the air) 

Barret 
         "We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could 
be the leader." 

Tifa 
         "You think so...?" 

(Aerith walks to Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "It would have to be Cloud." 

(Barret stops abruptly and looks at Aerith.) 

Barret 
         "^#$^%....... awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If 
something happens, we'll meet up there." 

(Barret sits down.) 

Barret 
         "'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. Split 
us into 2 parties..." 

(Here Cloud picks the two people to come with him. I chose Tifa and Aerith.) 

Barret 
         "...Thought you'd do that." 
         "'Later, at Kalm!" 

(They all leave Midgar, and head out into the overworld for the first time.)








Scene 37 
- Cloud Begins His Story - 

(They arrive at the city of Kalm. It is a charming, idyllic town with a 
Dutch appearance.) 

Tifa 
         "So this is Kalm?" 

Aerith 
         "I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the 
inn!" 

(Aerith enters the inn) 

Tifa 
         "Let's go Cloud." 

(Tifa enters the inn. Cloud follows upstairs. The others are waiting.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, you're late!" 

Barret 
         "Yo man, you're late!" 

Cloud 
         "Sorry to keep you waiting." 

Aerith 
         "Guess everyone's here now." 

Barret 
         "So let's hear your story......" 
         "You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the 
planet." 
         "Let's hear it all." 

(Cloud looks at his feet.. then looks at Barret. The music fades.) 

Cloud 
         "......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER." 
         "After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became 
friends." 

Barret 
         "You call that a friend?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, well......." 
         "He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself." 

Tifa 
         "............" 

Cloud 
         "So I guess you'd call him a war buddy..... We trusted each 
other. Until one day......" 

Aerith 
         "...one day?" 

(Cloud turns away from the others.) 

Cloud 
         "After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance 
against the Shinra." 
         "...........that was 5 years ago." 
         "I was 16........" 








Scene 38 
- Our Monster - 

(The scene changes. We are now in a military truck, on a bumpy ride along 
an old, almost-forgotten road. The windshield wipers do little to defend 
against the pounding rain. Boxes and crates are strewn about. Cloud stands 
near the back of the truck. Two Shinra soldiers sit on crates. Sephiroth
sits on another.) 

Cloud 
         "It sure is raining hard." 

(He walks over to one of the guards. He isn't looking well.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey, how are you doing?" 

(The soldier makes a dismissive gesture, then sinks down lower.) 

         "I'm all right." 

Cloud 
         "I wouldn't know..." 
         "I've never had motion sickness." 

(He walks to the other guard.) 

Cloud 
         "Everything okay?" 

(He walks to the middle of the truck. Sephiroth looks up.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Hey." 

(Cloud turns.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Settle down." 

(Cloud starts doing his squat thrusts.) 

Cloud 
         "They gave me new Materia." 
         "I can't wait to use it." 

Sephiroth 
         "...just like a kid." 

(Cloud stops.) 

Cloud 
         "You going to brief us about this mission?" 

Sephiroth 
         "...this isn't a typical mission." 

Cloud 
         "Good!" 

Sephiroth 
         "Why do you say that?" 

(Cloud walks to the back of the truck and looks out.) 

Cloud 
         "I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you." 
         "But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over." 
         "My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war." 
         "That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind 
of a way to prove myself." 

(He turns.) 

Cloud 
         "Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?" 

Sephiroth 
         "...I thought you wanted a briefing?" 

(Cloud smooths his hair and walks to Sephiroth.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor." 
         "There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing 
brutal creatures." 
         "First, we will dispose of those creatures, Then, we'll locate 
the problem and neutralize it." 

(Cloud taps his foot.) 

Cloud 
         "Brutal creatures... Where?" 

Sephiroth 
         "The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim." 

Cloud 
         "Nibelheim..." 
         "That's where I'm from." 

(Sephiroth nods.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Hmm... hometown..." 

(A loud crash rattles the whole truck. The driver turns to the back.) 

         "Sir...s, something strange just crashed into our truck!" 

(Sephiroth stands.) 

Sephiroth 
         "That would be our Monster..." 

(Battle sequence in which Sephiroth and Cloud fight a massive dragon. We 
see that Sephiroth has 30 times Cloud's HP, and can do about 300 times the
damage. Sephiroth never loses any HP to the dragon's attacks. The scene 
changes, back to the inn at Kalm.) 
  
Cloud 
         "Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality 
than any story you might have heard about him." 

Aerith 
         "So... Where do you come in?" 

Cloud 
         "Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought." 

Tifa 
         ".........." 

Cloud 
         "......and then we reached Nibelheim." 








Scene 39 
- Nibelheim - Homecoming - 

(The scene changes again. We are now at the front gate of Nibelheim, 
Cloud's hometown. Sephiroth approaches the gate, then stops and turns.) 

Sephiroth 
         "How does it feel?" 

(He looks around.) 

Sephiroth 
         "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?" 
         "So how does it feel?" 
         "I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..." 

Cloud (offscreen) 
         "Umm.... how 'bout your parents?" 

Sephiroth 
         "My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. 
My father..." 

(He laughs.) 

Sephiroth 
         "What does it matter...?" 
         "All right, let's go." 

(He walks into Nibelheim. Cloud and the two guards follow.) 

Guards 
         "Psst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get into 
trouble.)" 

         "It's so boring, being on watch." 

<CHOICE> 
         You want to do what we always do? 
         Jut sit tight, it's your job, right? 

***Cloud 
         You want to do what we always do? 

Cloud 
         "Shall we practice?" 

         "Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose." 
         "Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what 
other people think?" 
         "...How did it go?" 

(He poses.) 

         "Was it like this?" 

Cloud 
         "Good job!" 

(He relaxes.) 

         "I really don't want to be in SOLDIER." 

***Cloud 
         Just sit tight, it's your job, right?" 

Cloud 
         "I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it." 
<//> 

(He speaks with Sephiroth.) 

Sephiroth 
         "The Mako smell is pretty bad here." 

(Cloud continues into Nibleheim. The screen fades to black.) 

Barret 
         "Yo wait a minute!!" 

(Nibelheim fades back in. Sephiroth and the guards are gone. Cloud turns.) 

Barret 
         "Isn't that, um...?" 
         "The name of Sephiroth's mother..." 

(The scene changes back to the inn.) 

Barret 
         "I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the 
Shinra building." 

Cloud 
         "That's right." 

Tifa 
         "Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You 
can ask questions later." 

Barret 
         "Tifa, I was only......" 

Tifa 
         "Okay Cloud, continue." 

Aerith 
         "It's a reunion of childhood pals!" 

Cloud 
         "......I was really surprised with Tifa." 

(The screen fades to black.) 

Cloud 
         "...The town was quiet." 
         "Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out 
because of the monsters." 
         "No, maybe they're afraid of us..." 

(The scene returns to Nibelheim. We are at a courtyard, just inside the 
gate.) 

Sephiroth 
         "We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep 
early." 

(He opens the door of the inn, stops, and turns around) 

Sephiroth 
         "All that we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest." 

(A guard runs forward. Sephiroth turns.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Oh, that's right..." 
         "You may visit your family and friends." 

(Sephiroth enters the inn.) 

People in Nibelheim 
         "Man.. I'm so nervous." 

<CHOICE> 
         How come? 
         I'm excited. 

***Cloud 
         How come? 

         "Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?" 

***Cloud 
         I'm excited. 

         "...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero..." 
<//> 

         "I heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready." 
         "I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster." 

<CHOICE> 
         Take my picture. 
         Better get back in the house, it's dangerous. 

***Cloud 
         Take my picture. 

         "I don't take pictures with nobodys." 

***Cloud 
         Better get back in the house, it's dangerous. 

         "All right... so big-headed......." 
         "Hey? This guy's a real..." 
         "You.... Are you Cloud?" 
         "Really? So that's how it is, huh?" 
         "Gosh, Cloud, you've grown up to be a nice-looking kid." 

<CHOICE> 
         Then take my picture 
         It's dangerous, get back in your house 

***Cloud 
         Then take my picture 

         "Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with 
Sephiroth." 

***Cloud 
         It's dangerous, get back in your house 

         "OK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant" 
<//> 

         "Welcome." 
         "Hey? Aren't you..." 

(The screen flashes white... The person vanishes.) 

Cloud 
         "...Have I come here before? ...I don't remember." 

Barret 
         "Now you're pissin' me off! This don't matter, so get on with it!" 

(Cloud enters a house.) 

Cloud 
         "This is... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident 
five years ago." 

(The screen fades black.) 

Barret 
         "Yo wait, I wanna hear." 

Aerith 
         "Me too! It's been a long time, right?" 

Barret 
         "Tell us more!" 
         "You saw your family, right?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't want to talk about it 
         All right...... 

***Cloud 
         Don't want to talk about it 

Barret 
         "Well I ain't gonna force ya....." 

***Cloud 
         All right...... 

Cloud 
         "I don't know if you could call it a 'family'........" 
         "My father... died when I was still very young." 
         "That's why my mom...... was living alone in this house." 
         "Yeah, I saw my mom." 
         "My mom... she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all." 
         "But a few days later, she died...." 
         "But when I saw her, she looked fine." 

(The scene returns to Cloud's house. Cloud takes a few more steps inside. 
We see his mother, working in the kitchen. She turns.) 

Cloud 
         "Uh...?" 

(She comes forward.) 

         "Ye---s?" 

(She runs to him.) 

         "Cloud!?" 

(She nods.) 

         "Welcome home, Cloud!" 

Cloud 
         "Hi, mom." 

(The screen goes white.... Cloud is standing on the few steps leading up 
to a small sitting-area. His mother is by him.) 

         "Come, come... Let me take a look at you!"

(She looks at him from the side.) 

         "Hmmm......." 

(She looks at him from the back.) 

         "You look so handsome." 

(She walks to the front again.) 

         "So is this a SOLDIER uniform?" 

Cloud 
         "......Mom, I...." 

(The screen goes white again... Cloud is lying on the bed by the kitchen 
[it's a one-room house].) 

         "My, how you've grown." 
         "I bet the girls never leave you alone." 

Cloud 
         "...Not really." 

         "...I'm worried about you." 

(She paces a little.) 

         "There are a lot of temptations in the city..." 
         "I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice 
girlfriend." 

Cloud 
         "...I'm all right." 

         "You should have..." 
         "an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you." 
         "I think that would be the perfect type for you." 

Cloud 
         "......I'm not interested." 

(The screen flashes white again. Cloud and his mother are standing in the 
kitchen.) 

         "Are you eating right?" 

(He nods.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm all right. The Company takes care of me." 

         "Is that so?" 
         "You can't cook, right?" 
         "I was worried sick about how you were doing..." 

(The screen flashes white again. Cloud's mother turns to face him from 
the stove.) 

         "Cloud...?" 

(The screen flashes white.) 

         "You know, Cloud......" 

(Flash.) 

         ".......isn't that right, Cloud?" 

(Flash.) 

         "I will always be your mother..." 

(The screen fades to black.) 

Cloud 
         ".........Let's stop this......" 

(We return to Nibelheim...) 
<//> 

(Cloud enters Tifa's house. He takes a few steps in, then the screen fades 
to black.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud...?" 
         "Did you go into my house?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah... 
         No... 

***Cloud 
         Yeah... 

Cloud 
         "I thought you might be home." 

***Cloud 
         No... 

Cloud 
         "I remember you weren't there." 
<//> 

(Cloud goes upstairs.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud...?" 
         "Did you go into my room?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah....... 
         No.... 

***Cloud 
         Yeah....... 

(He continues.) 

***Cloud 
         No... 

(Back to the foyer.) 
<//> 

(Cloud opens a chest of drawers. He pulls out Orthopedic Underwear.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!!!" 

<CHOICE> 
         It's true 
         Just kidding. Don't get mad... 

***Cloud 
         It's true 

Tifa 
         "...Cloud" 
         "We're talking about something really important here." 

***Cloud 
         Just kidding. Don't get mad... 

Tifa 
         "...Cloud" 
         "We're talking about something really important here." 
<//> 

(Cloud walks to the piano in Tifa's room.) 

Tifa 
         "Did you play my piano?" 

<CHOICE> 
         No, I didn't 
         Yeah, I jammed on it 
         Just a little 

***Cloud 
         No, I didn't 

(He doesn't play.) 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, I jammed on it 

         "Now, how did this go?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I forgot 
         I remember 

***Cloud 
         I forgot 

(A tutorial comes up explaining how to play the piano. Cloud plays.) 

***Cloud 
         I remember 

(He plays the piano.) 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         Just a little 

Cloud 
         "I can read sheet music, too, you know..... Ummmm, let's 
see......" 
         "Do... Re.... Mi... Ti... La... Do... Re... Mi... Ti... La....
Do... Re.... Do.... forget..." 
<//> 

(He walks to the Tifa's desk.) 

Cloud 
         "The letter..." 

Tifa 
         "Did you read it? My letter?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'd never do that! 
         Yeah... 

***Cloud 
         I'd never do that! 

Tifa 
         "Of course!" 

***Cloud 
         Yeah... 

Tifa 
         "You remember what it said? 

<CHOICE> 
         I don't remember... 
         I remember clearly 

***Cloud 
         I don't remember... 

Tifa 
         "Then. let's go on with the story about Sephiroth." 

***Cloud 
         I remember clearly 

Cloud 
         "I read it..." 
         "It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that 
runs the General Store..." 

         "Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago." 
         "Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only 
person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud." 
         "But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if 
we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway." 
         "Well, enough about him." 
         "Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so 
behind on everything... so out of it." 
         "Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean." 
         "Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a 
really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some 
money." 
         "...but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job fast. That's 
right. I still haven't found a job yet." 
         "I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with 
Shinra, Inc." 
         "I wonder if it's too late to back. Sometimes I think I should've 
taken over my parents' store." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, do you remember all of it?" 

<CHOICE> 
         No, that's it 
         Yeah, I remember it all 

***Cloud 
         No, that's it 

Tifa 
         "Then. let's go on with the story about Sephiroth." 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, I remember it all 

Cloud 
         "Because there was some stuff about me..." 

         "I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is 
Nibelheim." 
         "Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working?" 
         "Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at 
the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?" 
         "And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen 
you for years." 
         "We were all talking about you last night." 
         "Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I 
couldn't very well stab them in the back." 
         "I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being 
jilted." 
         "Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!" 
         "So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again." 
         "P.S. Write me back, okay?" 
<//> 
<//> 
<//> 

         "...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome." 
         "Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, Cloud! I didn't recognize you." 

(Two kids run into the room.) 

         "Shinra----?" 

         "Chinra---?" 

         "SOLDIER?" 

         "Saltza?" 

         "Are you going to kill the monsters?" 

         ".....are you going to?" 

         "Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man." 

         "Do your best." 

         "Do your best." 

         ".....Hmmmm" 
         "Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?" 

Cloud 
         "And who are you?" 

         "I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial 
arts." 

(He jumps over Cloud.) 

Zangan 
         "I have 128 students all over the world!" 
         "In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student." 

Cloud 
         "Did you say Tifa?" 

Zangan 
         "Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter." 

         "The, uh.... The whole Inn's booked up by Shinra for the night." 
         "...?" 
         "Cloud...?" 
         "Is it you, Cloud?" 
         "It must've been two years." 
         "Say, you've really moved up in the world, being under Sephiroth's 
command." 

(Cloud goes to the second floor of the inn. Sephiroth stands on the 
landing, looking out the window.)

Cloud 
         "What are you looking at?" 

(A guard comes upstairs and goes into the bedroom.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...This scenery.......I feel like I know this place." 
         "..........." 
         "We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon." 

<CHOICE> 
         It's still early. 
         Yeah, let's get some sleep. 

***Cloud 
         It's still early. 

Sephiroth 
         "...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow." 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, let's get some sleep 

Sephiroth 
         "I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor." 
         "I've heard she's young. I hope we can rely on her..." 

(They go to sleep.) 
<//> 





  
  

Scene 40 
- The Mountains Of Nibel - 

(The next morning. The group is outside, near the Shinra Mansion. Cloud 
speaks to Sephiroth.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Once the guide gets here, we're heading out." 

(Tifa enters, wearing a kawaii cowboy hat. Tifa's father steps forward.) 

Tifa's father 
         "Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens..." 

Sephiroth 
         "...Trust me." 

Tifa 
         "I'll be all right, Dad!" 
         "I have two men from SOLDIER with me." 

(She turns to Sephiroth.) 

Tifa 
         "I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!" 

Cloud 
         "Tifa! You're the guide?" 

(He runs forward.) 

Tifa 
         "That's right." 
         "I just happen to be the number one guide in this town."

Cloud 
         "It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!" 

(Sephiroth takes a step toward the town exit, then turns to Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Then there's no problem if you respect her." 
         "....Let's go." 

(He walks to the exit. The photographer from before steps forward.) 

         "Ummm....." 

(Sephiroth turns.) 

         "Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!" 
         "Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?" 

(Cloud stands by the wall of the Shinra Mansion. Tifa stands next to him. 
Sephiroth, slowly, comes over and stands by Tifa.) 

         "Cheeeeese!" 

(The photographer takes the picture. Sephiroth immediately walks toward 
the exit again.) 

         "Great, thank you!" 
         "I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!" 
  
(FMV sequence of a flyby of the dark, foreboding Nibel Mountains.) 

         There was a Mako Reactor built in Mt. Nibel. 
         The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different... 

(We see the party walking along a mountain path, then Cloud at a rickety
rope bridge. He begins walking across and meets Tifa standing in the 
middle. She continues a bit. The two guards catch up.) 

Tifa 
         "It gets harder from here! Follow
me!" 

(She runs the rest of the way across. Cloud follows. He meets Tifa and 
Sephiroth near the opposite side, when the screen starts to shake...) 

Tifa 
         "Uh... the bridge!!"

(The bridge breaks in the middle. FMV sequence of the collapsing bridge. 
Cloud grabs Tifa's hand, holding her up, then Cloud falls, then everyone. 
The camera follows the broken, empty bridge as it swings, colliding with 
the side of the canyon. The scene changes again. We see the party, sans 
one guard, land at the foot of the canyon...) 

Sephiroth 
         "Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?" 

 Tifa 
         "These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm..." 
         "Oh, and Sephiroth.... There seems to be one person missing..."

Sephiroth 
         "It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We 
can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here." 

(Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth, and the one remaining guard travel along the path,
reaching a cave, dimly lit but with brightly colored, sparkling walls.) 

Cloud 
         "What's this?" 

Tifa 
         "A mysteriously colored cave..."

Sephiroth 
         "It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant 
in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here." 

(They continue through the cave, reaching a beautiful, glittering fountain.) 

Cloud 
         "...And what's this?" 

Sephiroth 
         "A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature." 

Tifa 
         "It's so beautiful..." 

(She walks to the fountain.) 

Tifa 
         "If the Mako Reactor countinues to suck up the energy, this 
fountain will dry up too..."

(Sephiroth comes to the fountain.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced." 
         "It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state." 

(Cloud walks to the fountain.) 

Cloud 
         "By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also 
use magic too?" 

Sephiroth 
         "You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?" 
         "...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the 
materia." 
         "Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land
 and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet 
calling up magic..... or so they say." 

Cloud 
         "Magic...... a mysterious power." 

(Tifa looks around, then bends down.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha!" 

Cloud 
         "Did I say somethin' funny?" 

Sephiroth 
         "A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as 
mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called magic!" 
         "I still remember how angry he was." 

Cloud 
         "Who was that?" 

Sephiroth 
         "Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take 
over the work of a great scientist." 
         "He was a walking mass of complexes." 

(Tifa looks up.) 

Tifa 
         "A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the A
ncients is." 
  
  






Scene 41 
- Monsters Of The Nibel Reactor - 

(We are at the Mako Reactor in Mt. Nibel. The group approaches the stairs 
up to the entrance.)

Tifa 
         "We finally made it. We sure took the long way though." 

Cloud 
         "Tifa, you wait here." 

Tifa 
         "I'm going inside too! I wanna see!" 

(Sephiroth climbs halfway up the stairs, then looks over his shoulder at 
Tifa.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of 
Shinra's industrial secrets." 

Tifa 
         "But!" 

(Sephiroth turns to the guard.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Take care of the lady." 

(Cloud and Sephiroth climb up the stairs and enter the reactor. The guard 
blocks Tifa's path in.) 

Tifa 
         "Mm, man!" 

(She turns away and angrily plants her hands on her hips.) 

Tifa 
         "Better take real good care of me then!" 
  
(We see Cloud following Sephiroth into the Mako reactor. Look at the 
picture... look familiar? Cloud follows him through a door. The next room 
is bathed in red light. There are many metal pods in rows, each with a 
clear glass portal to look into. Sephiroth is standing at the top of the 
stairs leading though the middle of the rows. There is a door by him. 
Above the door is a plate with one word engraved on it- Jenova....) 

Cloud 
"This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open..." 

(Cloud follows him partway back down the stairs, then stops. Sephiroth 
examines one of the pods.)


Sephiroth 
         "This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken." 
         "Cloud, close the valve." 

(He walks to another pod. Cloud closes the valve on the first pod, then 
walks to Sephiroth.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Why did it break...?" 

(He jumps up and peers into the viewport of the pod. He speaks to himself.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...now I see, Hojo." 
         "But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as 
Professor Gast." 

(To Cloud) 

Sephiroth 
         "This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... 
that is, when it's working correctly." 
         "Now, what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?" 

Cloud 
         "Uh, umm...... Oh yeah!  It becomes a Materia." 

Sephiroth 
         "Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take 
a look." 
         "Look through the window." 

(Cloud hops up, peers into the pod and sees... a hideous, unnatural 
monster. He lets go of his handhold below the portal and lands sitting on 
the floor.)

Cloud 
         "Wh... what is this!?" 

Sephiroth 
         "Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered 
with Mako." 
         "You're different from the others, but still human." 
         "But what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of 
Mako, far more than you." 

(Cloud gets to his feet.) 

Cloud 
         "...Is this some kind of monster?" 

Sephiroth 
         "Exactly. And it's Hojo if Shinra that produced these monsters." 
         "Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what 
these monsters really are." 

Cloud 
         "Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?" 

(Sephiroth clutches his head, trembling.) 

Cloud 
         "H... hey, Sephiroth!" 

(He puts out his hand.) 

Sephiroth 
         "N... no...." 

(Sephiroth stops trembling.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...Was I?" 

(He draws his sword and begins furiously attacking the pods. Cloud jumps 
away.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...Was I created this way too?" 

(He slashes at the first pod.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Am I the same as all these monsters....." 

(Cloud interrupts.) 

Cloud 
         "...Sephiroth." 

(Sephiroth just continues attacking the pod with his sword... then after 
a long moment, he stops, his shoulders heaving.) 

Sephiroth 
         "You saw it! All of them.... were humans...." 

Cloud 
         "Human!? No way!" 

(Sephiroth stops and turns towards Cloud, his sword still drawn.) 

Sephiroth 
         "....I've always felt since I was small..." 
         "That I was different from the others. Special, in some way." 
         "But... not like this...." 

(He looks down, shaking his head. Suddenly, there is a loud noise and he 
jerks his head up. FMV sequence. One of the pods explodes with a hiss of 
steam. The front half falls foward, revealing another monster, like the 
one Cloud saw. It lies there on the overturned dome of metal, not 
fully formed, twitching..... repulsive. The screen fades to black.)

         Am I... human? 
         I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time. 
         I was even more surprised by that fact that Shinra was producing
monsters.

(The scene changes back to the inn at Kalm.) 

Barret 
         "Damn, Shinra! the more I hear, the more I hate 'em!" 

Tifa 
         "......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret 
like that." 

Red XIII 
         "That would seem to explain the increase in the number of 
monsters recently." 
         "I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so 
Barret?" 

Barret 
         "(Why you talkin' to me!?)" 

<CHOICE> 
         Save game and take a rest 
         Keep talking 

***Cloud 
         Save game and take a rest 

Barret 
         "Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?" 

(The PLAYER can save the game) 

***Cloud 
         Keep talking 
<//> 
  
(We are in the inn at Kalm.) 

Aerith 
         "Tifa.... You were waiting outside then?" 

Tifa 
         ".....Yes." 

Cloud 
         "We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. 
He didn't even try to talk to me." 

Tifa 
         "Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?" 

Cloud 
         "We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim." 

Tifa 
         "The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion." 

Cloud 
         "Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion..."








Scene 42 
- Sephiroth's Thirst For Knowledge - 

(The scene is now Nibelheim. Cloud runs out of the inn with a guard, 
then runs to Shinra mansion. He passes through a group of people milling 
outside the gate, then enters. He climbs to a bedroom on the top floor. A 
guard is waiting at the door.) 

         "There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this 
room..." 

(Cloud enters the bedroom. He passes through a secret door in the 
fireplace, down a long spiral staircase, and through a dark cave. He 
reaches a secret library, where Sephiroth paces back and forth, absorbed
in a book.)

Sephiroth 
         "....an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 
year old geological stratum." 
         "Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova..." 

(The camera pans up.) 

Sephiroth 
         "X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient..." 
         "X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako 
Reactor 1 approved for use..." 

(Sephiroth walks down a narrow hallway lined with books. He stops and 
looks upwards.) 

Sephiroth 
         "My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a 
coincedence?"

(He looks downward.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did 
you die?" 

(Cloud leaves. The camera returns to the book-lined hallway. As Cloud 
speaks, we see a series of images of Sephiroth, reading. With each 
successive image, the bookshelves become emptier, and the stacks of books 
on the floor grow higher.) 

         Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion... 
         He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and 
not once, did the light in the basement go out... 





  
  

Scene 43 
- Realization - 

(Cloud is lying on a bed on the first floor of the Shinra Mansion. He 
awakens, and goes down to the library, passing the guard in the bedroom.) 

     "Sephiroth seems different." 

(He continues down the stairs to the library. When he arrives, Sephiroth 
laughs from offscreen.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha..." 

(Cloud runs down the hallway of books, to the inner reading room.)

Sephiroth 
         "Who is it!?" 

(Sephiroth is seated at a large desk, surrounded by books. The shelves 
that line the walls are in several places bare of books, and a couple of 
the shelves have fallen down.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Hmph... traitor." 

Cloud 
         "Traitor?" 

Sephiroth 
         "You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you." 

(He faces the wall.) 

Sephiroth 
         "This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a 
itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on..." 
         "At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the 
Promised Land and supreme happiness." 

(He turns to Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped 
their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life." 
         "They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without 
giving one whit in return!" 

(He looks down.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Those are your ancestors." 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth..." 

Sephiroth 
         "Long ago, disaster struck this planet." 

(He looks up and walks to another spot, facing the wall.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid." 
         "The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your 
ancestors continued to increase." 

(He looks at Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports." 

Cloud 
         "What does that have to do with you?" 

Sephiroth 
         "Don't you get it?" 

(He stands next to Cloud, not facing him, but facing down the hallway.) 

Sephiroth 
         "An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 
2000 years ago." 
         "The Jenova Project." 

(He holds his face.) 

Sephiroth 
         "The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of 
the Ancients..... no, the Cetra." 

(He looks up and straightens.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...I am the one that was produced." 

(Cloud turns to face him. Sephiroth does not turn.) 

Cloud 
         "Pr... produced!?" 

(The camera is now looking at Cloud and Sephiroth from down the narrow 
hallway.)  

Sephiroth 
         "Yes." 
         "Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius 
scientist, produced me." 

(Sephiroth walks down the hallway, then stops and stands motionless at 
the end.) 

Cloud 
         "How... how did he...?"

He runs after Sephiroth, then stops.) 

Cloud 
         "Se... Sephiroth?" 

Sephiroth 
         "Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother." 

(He walks, determinedly, out of the library. Cloud follows, out of the 
mansion.) 



                                                
                                                



Scene 44 
- Nibelheim Aflame - Tifa's Revenge - 

(Cloud exits the Shinra Mansion. The entire village is consumed in fire; 
flames and smoke reaching high into the sky. He runs to the courtyard. 
Zangan is tending to an injured person lying on the ground.) 

Zangan 
         "Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?" 
         "Then come over here and help me!" 

(Cloud runs to Zangan, leaping over a piece of flaming debris.) 

Zangan 
         "I'll check this house. You check that one over there!" 

(He runs into the house next to the Inn. Cloud speaks to the person on the 
ground. It's the photographer from before.) 

         "Hey, Ummm... Am I going to die?" 

(A guard is lying on the ground near Tifa's house.) 

         "Sephi... roth" 

(Cloud runs into the house next to Tifa's, his mother's house, then runs 
out. He shakes his head sadly, then walks to the center of the courtyard. 
The screen fades to black.) 

Cloud 
         "Terrible..." 
         "Sephiroth... This is too terrible..."

(The camera switches to an angle where we can see both the courtyard and 
the Shinra Mansion. Near the steps leading down to the courtyard stands 
Sephiroth. Two townspeople rush toward him in an attempt to subdue him. He 
cuts them down with his sword. FMV sequence. Sephiroth stands in the midst 
of the flames, an empty expression on his face, then walks away, through 
the fire, unharmed. A flyby of the Nibel Mountains, past the Mako Reactor. 
Cloud dashes into the reactor and climbs down to the entrance to the pod 
room. Tifa is kneeling in front of the door. A long, thin, sword is on the 
floor nearby. A man lies before her, dead.) 

Tifa 
         "Papa..." 

(She leans down to him.) 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth!?" 

(She straightens.) 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?" 

(She slumps forward.) 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!" 

(She sits up; then, in fury-) 

Tifa 
         "I hate them all!" 

(She stands, picks up the sword, then runs into the pod room. Cloud 
follows.) 
  
(Sephiroth stands before the thick steel door at the top of the stairs in 
the pod room. He places his hands on the door.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door." 

(The camera pans downward. We see Tifa, wielding Sephiroth's sword and 
assuming a fighting stance, at the bottom of the stairs.) 

Tifa 
         "How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?"

(She runs up the stairs in a blind fury. She tries to attack Sephiroth, 
who wrestles the blade away from her with ease. He cuts Tifa down. The 
sound of his blade echoes as we see Tifa, in slow motion, fly backwards 
and land, crumpled, at the bottom of the stairs. Cloud runs into the room 
and stops, in shock. Sephiroth, carrying his sword, turns calmly and walks 
into Jenova's room. Cloud runs to Tifa and kneels by her.) 

Tifa 
         "...You promised... You promised that you'd come.... when I was 
in trouble..." 

(Cloud picks up her up, gently, then carefully, tenderly, leans her 
against one of the pods. He rushes up the stairs, after Sephiroth.) 





  
  

Scene 45 
- J-E-N-O-V-A - 

(Jenova's room. We see Jenova, a bizarre female being hidden beneath oddly 
angelic armor, connected to a mass of machines and electrical equipment. 
The camera pans down to show Sephiroth, standing facing his mother with 
his arms raised.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Mother, let's take this planet back together." 
         "I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land." 

(Cloud enters the room, coming up behind Sephiroth.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth..." 
         "My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?"

(Sephiroth, slowly, looks down and lowers his arms. His shoulders start
bouncing.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha..... They've come again, mother." 

(He stops laughing.) 

Sephiroth 
         "With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was 
destined to become the ruler of this Planet." 

(FMV sequence. Sephiroth speaks to Jenova, 

         But they... 
         Those worthless creatures 
         are stealing the planet from Mother 
         But now I'm here with you 
         so don't worry 

then tears the upper half of her armor off, snapping wires and intricate 
machinery. We see what was inside the armor. Jenova's true form. A fragile, 
alien woman, skin blue as if she was frozen for many years.) 

(Cloud brandishes his sword.) 

Cloud 
         "What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of 
having my hometown taken away from me!?" 
         "It's the same as your sadness!" 

(Sephiroth stands by Jenova, his arms raised, holding his sword high.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?" 
         "I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this 
Planet." 
         "I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people 
for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?" 

(Cloud turns his face away.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth.... I trusted you..." 

(He looks up and raises his sword.) 

Cloud 
         "No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!" 

(The camera cuts between Cloud and Sephiroth, slowly at first, then 
building speed, until the two of them seem to blur into each other, Cloud 
with his sword raised for battle, Sephiroth, chin on his chest, his 
sword-grip held close to his face... the screen goes white.)





  
  

Scene 46 
- What A Fascinating Story... - 

(Cloud and the others are in the inn at Kalm.) 

Cloud 
         "....and that's the end of my story." 

Barret 
         "Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?" 

Cloud 
         "....I don't remember." 

Aerith 
         "What happened to Sephiroth?" 

Cloud 
         "In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him." 

Tifa 
         "Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the 
newspaper." 

Aerith 
         "Shinra, Inc. owns the newspaper, so you can't rely on that i
nformation." 

Cloud 
         "......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened 
then." 
         "I challenged Sephiroth amd lived. Why didn't he kill me?" 

Tifa 
         ".......I'm alive, too." 

Aerith 
         "Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? 
It was in the Shinra building, right?" 

Cloud 
         "Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar." 

Aerith 
         "Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from 
the Shinra building." 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth.....?" 

(A pause.) 

Barret 
         "Damn! Don't none of this make sense!" 
         "I'm going, going, going, gone!" 
         "And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!" 

(Barret stops by the top of the stairs.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!" 

<CHOICE> 
         Wait a sec 
         Right 

***Cloud 
         Wait a sec 

Barret 
         "Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth 
heads for the Promised Land?" 
         "I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If 
they do, then we're all screwed." 
         "Y'know what I'm sayin'!" 

<CHOICE> 
         Beautiful, just beauiful! 
         Is that all? 

***Cloud 
         Beautiful, just beautiful! 

Barret 
         "Y'all jes' leave it to me!" 

***Cloud 
         Is that all? 

Cloud 
         "Oh brother..." 

Barret 
         "Fine! That's good enough." 

<//> 

***Cloud 
         Right 

Barret 
         "Yo, c'mon let's go!"

(He runs out.) 

Cloud 
         "Oh brother..." 

Tifa 
         ".........." 
         "Cloud...?" 

(She walks forward. Cloud turns to her.) 

Tifa 
         "How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?" 

Cloud 
         "I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad." 

Tifa 
         ".........." 

Aerith 
         "I..." 
         "The Ancients..... Cetra.... Jenova...... Sephiroth and 
myself....." 

Tifa 
         "Let's go. Barret's waiting." 

(Everyone leaves except Red XIII, still seated by the window, tail 
twitching curiously.) 

Red XIII 
         "What a fascinating story....." 








Scene 47 
- The Village Of Kalm - 

(Cloud comes downstairs into the lobby of the inn in Kalm. Barret and Red 
XIII are waiting.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, Cloud. Here." 

(Barret gives Cloud the "PHS.") 

         (Changing party members) Access the menu and select [PHS]. It can 
only be used on the World Map or at a Save Point. 

Red XIII 
         "[PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other." 

Barret 
         "Awright then, we're outta here..". 

People in Kalm 

         "Listen to me! 
         Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards 
that grassy field." 
         "And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary......." 

         "Tourists, huh? There are some things you should know that'll 
come in handy when you travel around the world........" 
         "Want me to tell you what they are?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Tell me 
         I already know 

***Cloud

         "Then let me explain how to use the world map." 
         "Well then, what do you want to know?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Changing the camera angle

***Cloud 
         Changing the camera angle 

         "First of all, press the [L2 button] on the controller to change 
the camera angle." 
         "There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like." 
         "You can then rotate the angles either way by pressing the 
[L1 button] and [R1 button]." 
         "Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It 
makes the journey a lot more fun!" 

***Cloud 
         Map indicators 

         "Press the [Start button] once to view the World Map." 
         "There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which, and you 
won't get lost as much." 
         "Push the [Start button] twice to change the size of the map, and 
once more to turn it off." 
         "Pretty easy, huh?" 

***Cloud 
         Operating the buttons 

         "You can ride things by pressing the [SELECT button] and get off 
by pressing the [cancel button]. This isn't so hard, either!" 
         "Oh, yes, yes. You can't dash with the World Map on, so make sure 
not to press the [cancel button] unless you get off." 
         "Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get 
off them, so be careful." 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         I already know 

         "Is that so? Well, have a nice trip." 
<//> 

         "Thanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, 
everything's more convenient now." 

         "The famous floating city, Midgar... Just once I'd love to see it 
in person." 

         "I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new 
president, was badly hurt."

<CHOICE> 
         Hey you're pretty clued!! 
         Don't care... 

***Cloud 
         Hey you're pretty clued!! 

         "Heh, heh, heh.... This is just between us. I heard it was that 
there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son." 

***Cloud 
         Don't care 

         "Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on 
what Shinra's doing." 
<//> 
         "Shinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are 
just gonna sit back and take it?" 

         "I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being 
sucked dry." 
         "We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy." 

         "My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after 
monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine." 
         "Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar..." 

         "Is it true that Shinra made a Monster?" 

<CHOICE> 
         It's true 
         Just a rumor 

***Cloud 
         It's true 

***Cloud 
         Just a rumor 
<//> 
         "Yeah, well, either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we 
can't stand up to Shinra." 

         "I got my health, and enough to eat... all's well." 

         "Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to 
Shinra." 
         "Don't you think?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, maybe 
         You're full of it 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, maybe 

         "See!? How would we get by without Mako energy?" 
  
***Cloud 
         You're full of it 

         "Hmmn. But I hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako 
energy." 
<//> 

         "Yeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all 
thanks to Shinra, Inc." 

         "Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient....." 
         "But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been 
disappearing at a rapid pace." 
         "I think the old life was better." 
         "Don't you think so?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, maybe 
         No way 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, maybe 

         "Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?" 

***Cloud 
         No way 

         "That sounds just like what my mom says." 
<//> 
         "I thought things were better when I was able to play with 
animals...." 

         "Did you say you came from
Midgar?" 
         "I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles 
lately." 

         "There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was 
carrying a wicked-looking sword." 

         "My older brother is so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could 
just puke!" 

         "When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training 
so hard now!!" 

         "I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor...." 
         "There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents lately. I hate 
it, just hate it." 

         "Me? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril 
Mine." 
         "But, right around then, monsters started appearing." 
         "After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here 
drinking."

         "It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around,
but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER." 

         "Stay out of the kitchen." 

         "This is the Item Store." (sells

Scene 48 
- Chocobo Chocobo - 

(Cloud and the others head east, to the Chocobo Stable. In the front 
pasture, several chocobos graze. Cloud speaks with one. After a brief 
conversation of "wark wark"s, the chocobo's dance the Chocobo Waltz! 
Afterwards, Cloud receives the Choco/Mog Summon materia. They go inside 
and meet with Choco Bill.) 

Choco Bill 
         "Thinking of crossing the marshes?"

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah 
         Not interested 

***Cloud 
         Yeah 

Choco Bill 
         "Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo." 
         "That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo." 
         "It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom." 
         "Midgar Zolom...?" 
         "It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!" 
         "It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes..." 
         "And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!" 
         "To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill and Choco Billy 
Chocobo Farm." 
         "To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the 
Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm." 

***Cloud 
         Not interested 

Choco Bill 
         "Hmm, then, I guess that's that." 
<//> 

(They go to the stable.) 

Choco Billy 
         "Do you want a Chocobo?" 

Cloud 
         "Mmm......" 

<CHOICE> 
         Give me one 
         Nope 

***Cloud

Choco Billy 
         "You old folks are out of luck!" 

Cloud 
         "Old folks...?" 

Choco Billy 
         "We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out 
there for someone else." 
         "You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and 
catch one." 
         "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Where are they? 
         How do I catch one? 
         What else? 
         Not interested 

***Cloud 
         Where are they? 

Choco Billy 
         "You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear 
in those areas." 
         "But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. 
They're very cautious animals by nature." 

<CHOICE> 
         Chocobo Lure? 
         Go on 

***Cloud 
         Chocobo Lure? 

Choco Billy 
         "'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos." 
         "If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they 
won't appear." 

***Cloud 
         Go on 

Choco Billy 
         "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         How do I catch one? 

Choco Billy 
         "A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters." 
         "But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters." 
         "That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch 
the Chocobo." 

<CHOICE> 
         And then? 
         That's all you can talk about? 

***Cloud 
         And then? 

Choco Billy 
         "Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from 
the slightest things." 
         "But, if you use 'Greens' they'll focus on that, and won't run 
away." 

***Cloud 
         That's all you can talk about? 

Choco Billy 
         "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         What else? 

Choco Billy 
         "Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, 
but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt." 
         "Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape." 
         "Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?" 

***Cloud 
         Not interested 
<//> 

***Cloud 
         Nope 

Choco Billy 
         "Oh, I'm so glad!" 
<//> 

Choco Billy 
         "Well then, shall we get down to business?" 
         "I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now." 
         "You want it?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Buy it 
         Don't buy it 

***Cloud 
         Buy it 

Choco Billy 
         "Thanks!" 
         "It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either." 
         "Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type 
of 'Greens you feed them." (sells greens) 

***Cloud 
         Don't buy it 

Choco Billy 
         "Mmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one." 
<//>

Chole 
         "Wasn't it really expensive?" 
         "But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa." 
         "Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this..." 

(If you go back to the house) 

Choco Bill 
         "By the way, there was another person heading towards the 
Marshes." 
         "Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a 
man in a Black Cape."



(They leave the farm, go out, and fight... and fight... until they catch a 
Chocobo. They cross the marshes to the Mythril Mine.) 





  
 

Scene 49 
- Zolom Impaled - The Mithril Mine - 

(Cloud and the others arrive at the Mythril Mine. In front of the mine, 
impaled on a stake, is a Midgar Zolom. They run forward.) 

Cloud 
         "Did Sephiroth... do this...?" 

Tifa 
         "Amazing..." 

Aerith 
         "Our enemy is someone that could
do this...?"

(They enter the Mythril Mine. Just inside, they meet up with Rude of the 
Turks. Elena stands on a stone outcropping high above.) 

Rude 
         "Just a second!" 

Tifa 
         "Who are you?" 

Rude 
         "Do you know who I am?" 

<CHOICE> 
         From the Turks, right?

***Cloud 
         From the Turks, right? 

Rude 
         "Well if you know, this won't take long." 
<//> 

Rude 
         "It's difficult to explain what the Turks do..." 

Cloud 
         "Kidnapping, right?" 

Rude 
         "To put it negatively... you could say that." 
         "...But, that's not all there is to it, anymore." 
         "................." 

(He looks around, then at the floor) 

Rude 
         "..................." 

         "Sir!" 

(The camera moves up to show Elena on a high ledge.) 

Elena 
         "It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't 
force it!" 

Rude 
         "...Then Elena, explain." 

Elena 
         "I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you 
did to Reno, we're short of people." 
         "...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks...." 
         "In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed." 
         "And to try and stop you every step of the way." 

(She turns) 

Elena 
         "Wait a minute, it's the other way around. You're the ones that 
are getting in our way." 

(Tseng enters from the door outside.) 

Tseng 
         "...Elena. You talk too much." 

Elena 
         "Mr. Tseng!?" 

Tseng 
         "No need to tell them about our orders." 

Elena 
         "Sorry... Tseng." 

Tseng 
         "I thought I gave you other orders." 
         "Now go. Don't forget to file your report." 

Elena 
         "Oh! Right!" 

(She clicks her heels) 

Elena 
         "Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for 
Junon Harbor!" 

Tseng 
         "...Elena. You don't seem to understand." 

Elena 
         "Oh! I'm, I'm sorry..." 

Tseng 
         "...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away." 

Rude & Elena 
         "Yes sir!" 

(Elena climbs down. Rude climbs up to the ledge with Tseng. He turns.) 

Rude 
         "...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave 
him healed." 
         "He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new 
weapon." 

(He exits. Tseng steps forward.) 

Tseng 
         "Well, then..." 

(He looks at Aerith. She comes forward to meet his gaze.) 

Tseng 
         "Aerith. Long time no see." 
         "Looks like you got away from Shinra for a while, now that 
Sephiroth reappeared." 

Aerith 
         "...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to 
Sephiroth?" 

Tseng 
         "No..." 
         "Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care." 

Aerith 
         "...strange, hearing that from you." 

Tseng 
         "Well then, stay out of Shinra's way." 

(He exits. Cloud and the others follow.) 

[Note: Here, you have the option of playing the Condor Fort mini game for

Scene 50 
- Junon Fortress - Resuscitation - 

(Cloud and the others arrive at Junon Fortress.) 

Cloud 
         "What happened to this town? It's so run-down..." 

People in Junon 

         "Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than 
the Shinra people visit this town." 

         "Ever since... Shinra built that city up above during the war, 
...ugh, ugh." 
         "There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted... phew..." 

Cloud 
         "What kinda place is this?" 

         "Who are you people? Where did you come from?" 

Cloud 
         "Did you see a man with a black cape?" 

         "Hmm... I've never seen that feller before." 

         "HEY! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around 
here!!" 

         "If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it." (sells items) 
  
(Cloud and the others go down to the beach. A little girl is standing 
by the water.) 

         "He-y! Mr. Dolphin!" 

(She jumps up and down as a dolphin swims to the edge of the water.) 

         "My name is...... 
         Pri-scil-la! 
         Now you say it." 

(She turns and sees Cloud and the others.) 

Priscilla 
         "Who are you guys? Are you members of the Shinra, Inc.?" 

Aerith 
         "No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra." 

Cloud 
         "...that's how it is." 

Priscilla 
         "I don't believe you! Get out of here!" 

Cloud 
         "Great..." 

(The screen starts to shake...) 

Tifa 
         "Look at that!" 

(A huge sea creature comes onto the screen. Priscilla runs forward, 
swinging her fists.) 

         "Be careful Mr. Dolphin!" 

(She is hit by the creature and falls into the water. She does not get up.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey! Hold on, we're coming!" 

(Boss battle with Bottomswell)

(Cloud and the others all stand around Priscilla's unconscious body on 
the beach.) 

Cloud 
         "This is bad... You don't think she's dead, do you?" 

(They all look distressed) 

         "Priscilla!!" 

(They turn to see a man rush down to the beach and kneel by Priscilla.) 

         "Nope... she's not breathing..." 
         "Hey, that's it!" 

(He turns to Cloud) 

         "Young man, CPR, now!" 

Cloud 
         "Mouth to mouth!?" 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, hurry!" 

Cloud 
         "But,... she's just a girl....." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, what are you going to do?" 

         "What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you." 

Cloud 
         "Guess I gotta do it..." 

         "Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her." 
         "Hurry up and do it!" 

(Cloud gives Priscilla mouth to mouth resuscitation.) 

Priscilla 
         "Uh... ugh..." 

(Cloud stands up) 

         "Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?" 

(The man picks Priscilla up and carries her off. Cloud goes to her house 
where he stands in front of the door.) 

         "Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while." 

(Cloud goes to the house near the exit of the town. An old woman stands in 
the doorway.) 

         "Hey, come in for a while." 

(Cloud follows her inside.) 

         "I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla." 
         "You all must be tired. If you want some rest, stay here." 

(She leaves. She stops and turns in the doorway) 

         "Make yourselves at home." 

(She exits) 

Aerith 
         "Want to rest?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah..." 

<CHOICE> 
         We'll try later 
         Let's rest 

***Cloud 
         We'll try later 

***Cloud 
         Let's rest 

(They all sleep in the beds she has provided.) 
<//> 

(Cloud and the others go to sleep. The screen is black.) 

         "...That reminds me." 

         "You again?" 
         "...Who are you?" 

         "...You'll find out soon. ......But more importantly, 
5 years ago..." 

         "5 Years ago... Nibelheim?" 

         "When you went to Mt. Nibel then, Tifa was your guide, right?" 

         "Yeah.... I was surprised." 

         "But where was Tifa other than that?" 

         "...I dunno." 

         "It was a great place for you two to see each other 
again." 

         "...You're right." 

         "Why couldn't you see each other alone?" 

         "...I don't know. I can't remember clearly..." 

         "Why don't you try asking Tifa?" 

         "...Yeah." 

         "Then, get up!" 

         "Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!" 

(The screen fades in to show Tifa standing in the room. Cloud gets out of 
bed) 

Cloud 
         "Tifa..." 
         "When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?" 

Tifa 
         "...We saw each other, right?" 

Cloud 
         "The other time." 

(She crosses her arms) 

Tifa 
         "No... it was 5 years ago. I don't remember." 
         "But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick." 

(They run outside.) 

(Cloud arrives in the middle of Nibelheim. There are loud trumpet fanfares 
playing in the background. All the others are waiting.) 

Aerith 
         "I heard that girl regained consciousness." 

Tifa 
         "Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy 
all of a sudden...?" 

Barret 
         "Seems like something's goin' on up there!" 

Red XIII 
         "Does this have something to do with the Shinra?" 

(Cloud goes partway up the stairs to Priscilla's house, when Priscilla 
comes out to the top of the stairs.) 

Cloud 
         "Are you all right now?" 

Priscilla 
         "Umm... thanks for helping..." 

(They go down the stairs.) 

Priscilla 
         "I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc. ..." 

Cloud 
         "That's all right." 

Priscilla 
         "I'll give you something SPECIAL!" 
         "It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?" 

(Priscilla gives Cloud the Shiva materia.) 

Barret 
         "What's that music? It sure sounds lively." 

Priscilla 
         "I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra 
president." 

Barret 
         "Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects." 

Priscilla 
         "Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they 
were small." 
         "But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped 
shining here, and the water got polluted..." 
         "I was raised on that story amd hate Shinra so much, I could die!" 

Aerith 
         "You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, 
too?" 

         "What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?" 

Red XIII 
         "Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?" 

Barret 
         "We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the 
tower?" 

Priscilla 
         "No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the 
tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!" 
         "But... you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me!" 

(She runs down to the beach) 

Tifa 
         "High voltage tower......." 
         "I guess this means Cloud'll be allright." 

Aerith 
         "Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!" 

Red XIII 
         "We're counting on you, Cloud" 

(Cloud shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "Hey!!" 

(Everyone starts to walk away) 

Cloud 
         "Wait a second!" 

(Cloud speaks to each one) 

Red XIII 
         "That looks like a Shinra soldier." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of 
Shinra, Inc.!" 

Tifa 
         "Don't you just hate this?" 

Aerith 
         "You're probably right." 

(Cloud goes down to the beach. Priscilla is waiting there.) 

Priscilla 
         "Wait a minute." 

(Barret arrives in time to see the dolphin make a flying leap over a 
girder attached to the electric tower.) 

Barret 
         "Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump 
like that!" 

Priscilla 
         "Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps 
for me." 
         "Here!! This is for you, Cloud!" 

(She gives Cloud the whistle) 

Cloud 
         "A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?" 

Priscilla 
         "Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll 
jump you to the top of the pole!" 

Cloud 
         "Jump to the top of the pole?" 

         "See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, 
you can climb to the top of the town." 

Barret 
         "Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you." 
         "Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet." 

         "You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?" 

***Cloud 
         Sure 
<//> 

(Cloud swims to the base of the tower and blows the whistle. The dolphin 
jumps, bringing him with it, depositing him on the pole. He leaps over to 
a ladder and climbs to the top of the town.) 





  
  

Scene 51 
- Rufus' Homecoming -

(FMV sequence as Cloud climbs over the ladder onto a large deck. A huge 
airship, the Highwind, floats majestically above. Cloud travels to the 
interior of the base. Once inside, three soliders march by, followed by the 
captain. He catches Cloud.) 

         "Hey! You still dressed like that!? Come 'ere!" 
         "Here!! Get in the room!" 

(He pushes Cloud into the locker room.) 

         "Today's the big day when we welcome President Rufus! Hurry up 
and change!" 

Cloud 
         "It's the Shinra uniform." 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't change

***Cloud 
         Don't change 

Cloud

dumb..." 

         "Quit yappin'! Hurry up!" 

***Cloud 
         Change 

Cloud 
         "Brings back memories..." 

         "Quit yappin'! Hurry up!" 

Cloud 
         "A Shinra uniform..." 
         "I was so proud when I first put it on." 

(He jumps up and down, putting some pants on) 

Cloud 
         "I wonder when it was..." 
         "...I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore." 

(Cloud walks out in full Shinra attire) 

         "Wow! You look good in it!" 
         "You remember the Greeting procedure, right!?" 

(Cloud shrugs) 

         "...the look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show 
you again!" 
         "Do just like we do." 

(Two soldiers run in) 

         "Commander! We'll help too!" 
         "This is how to do it." 
         "We'll sing too!" 

         "All right! Show 'em!" 
         "Now, march! This's the Welcoming March!" 

         "Then! I'll sing along with you!" 

         "Quietly--!!" 
         "Aaah!" 
         "Aaah!" 
         "Hey, come on now." 
         "Now!" 

(The soldiers start singing the praises of Rufus, Shinra, etc. The captain 
instructs you.) 

         "Keep in step with the soldier next to you and march smoothly!" 
         "Once you're all in step, shoulder your gun!" 
         "Got it?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Not yet

***Cloud

<//> 

         "Good! Make sure you do well at the real parade!" 

(A third soldier comes in) 

         "Rufus has arrived! Preparation completed!" 

(The soldiers leave) 

         "All right, show time! Don't disgrace yourselves!" 

(Cloud follows them out of the locker room.) 
  
(We are at a long street in the middle of Junon. A helicopter hovers 
overhead. The captain is instructing the soldiers. Another soldier arrives.) 

         "Begin the Welcome Parade!" 

(They move out. A flyby of scores of soldiers marching in formation. 
Rufus drives by in the back seat of a convertible, waving in true 
ticker-tape parade style. Back in the base, Cloud follows the soldiers 
out. FMV sequence: a flyby of the Junon cannon. Back at the long street, 
the soldiers arrive.) 

         "Oh no! No one's here!" 
         "Late---!?" 

(A soldier runs to an alley) 

         "Hey! Rookie! It's because you're running around like that!!" 

         "Captain! We'll take a short cut!" 

         "Right!" 
         "Good idea." 
         "Get over here!" 

(Cloud goes to him) 

         "All right! You first!"

(You end up at the end of the alley. The soldiers are marching in formation 
down the street. The captain gives you instructions to sneak into the 
line, and Cloud does so, controlled by the PLAYER.) 

TV Producer 
         "What the hell was that soldier doing?" 

AD 
         "I don't know." 

         "Are the points up?" 

AD 
         "Well, it's so-so." 

         "Hmm..." 
         "Better send that soldier something." 

(You get an item. This whole scene can be different depending on your 
parade performance.) 

(Cloud arrives at the top of Junon, on a paved platform beneath a huge 
tram that leads higher up into the base. He gets in formation with several 
other soldiers. Rufus and Heidegger stand nearby.)

         "Good! We made it." 

         "Oh! President Rufus!" 

         "Hey! Line up and shut up." 

         "Don't make a move!" 

(The soldiers stand still. Heidegger turns to Rufus.) 

Rufus 
         "How's the job?" 

(He steps away) 

Rufus 
         "What happened to the Airship?" 

(Heidegger scratches his head) 

Heidegger 
         "The long range airship is still being prepared." 
         "It should be ready in about three more days. Gya haa haa!" 

Rufus 
         "Even the Air Force's Gelnika?" 

Heidegger 
         ".....Gya haa haa!" 

(Rufs steps toward him) 

Rufus 
         "Stop that stupid horse laugh." 
         "Things are different than when father was in charge." 

(Heidegger stops, slowly) 

Heidegger 
         "Gya..." 

Rufus 
         "Is the ship ready?" 

Heidegger 
         "Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly." 

(Rufus enters the tram. Heidegger stands there laughing. The soldiers 
disperse as Heidegger runs forward- right into Cloud. He smacks him around 
a bit before he follows Rufus into the tram.) 

         "What a disaster." 

         "Heidegger was really irritated..." 

         "The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't 
find him." 

Cloud 
         "Man in the Black Cape?" 

         "He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our 
soldiers." 

         "He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around 
that it was Sephiroth." 

         "Attention! Dismissed!" 

(The soldiers disperse except for Cloud. A captain walks right up to him) 

        "Hey! Hey you! You messing with the army?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Who cares? 
         What if I am? 

***Cloud 
         Who cares? 

***Cloud 
         What if I am? 
<//> 

         "You're too lazy!! No break for you!!" 
         "Get over here!" 

(He takes you into the locker room) 

         "This is the military, soldier! You orders for today are to send 
off President Rufus at the dock!"

         "I'll keep drilling you until it's time!" 

(The two soldiers from before come in) 

         "I'll help, sir!" 

         "Me too, sir!" 

         "All right!! Line up in order and show me your final pose!" 
         "Today's command is Formation!" 
         "Remember it!" 
         "Ready!?" 
         "Junon Military Send Off, BEGIN!" 

(The captain drills the soldiers on the send off- just a game of Simon 
Says. He shouts a button, the PLAYER pushes it. Simple.) 

         "All right! Now you try it!" 

(Now the PLAYER joins in in a drill.) 

         "So you got it?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Not yet 
         I've got it 

***Cloud 
         Not yet 

(You do it again!) 

***Cloud 
         I've got it! 
<//> 

         "All right! Don't mess up during the real thing!" 

         "Commander! What's today's special pose?" 

         "Huh? ...I haven't decided yet." 
         "All right, rookie! I'll let you decide!" 
         "Show me your best move!" 

Cloud 
         "Let's see... My best move is..." 

(He twirls his gun) 

         "Woo-----ow!" 

         "That's awesome!" 

         "All right! We'll go with that as today's special!" 
         "Practice it!" 

         "Yes sir!!" 

         "Yes sir!!" 

         "Well then! Meet at the dock! Don't be late!!" 
         "Attention! Dismissed!!"

(Cloud follows them to the dock. On the way, we see Rude on the long 
street. Cloud arrives and gets in formation.) 

         "All right, it's time!" 

         "President Rufus... has now arrived!" 
         "Ten... HUT!" 

(Rufus and Heidegger enter through some automatic doors.) 

         "This is it!! Junon Military Reception--!" 
         "Do it right--- Do it with enthusiasm...! Ready...!" 

(They perform the Parappa-esque reception ceremony.) 

Rufus 
         "Well done." 
         "Keep up the good work for Shinra, Inc." 

Heidegger 
         "Gya haa ha...!! Here's a special bonus for you!!" 
         "A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!" 

(You get an item depending on your performance. Rufus walks onto the boat.) 

Rufus 
         "Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, Cloud and his 
friends will show up, too." 

Heidegger 
         "We'll crush them as soon as we find them!" 

(Rufus turns) 

Rufus 
         "We can't have them get in our way." 

Heidegger 
         "Leave it up to me, sir! Gya haa ha!" 

Rufus 
         "I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh..." 

(He walks onto the boat) 

Heidegger 
         "Gya......" 

(He makes some angry threatening motions and runs onto the boat.) 

         "All right! Dismissed!" 

(The other two soldiers speak.) 

         "That was close." 

         "Heidegger's been really edgy lately." 

         "Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation." 

         "Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too." 

(The captain runs forward) 

         "Hey--! I thought you were dismissed!" 

(All the soldiers leave but Cloud) 

         "We've got some cleaning to do! Hurry up!" 

(The captain leaves. Cloud runs onto the boat. the screen goes black.) 

Cloud 
         "We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent." 
         "...even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms..." 

(On the world map, we see the boat leave Junon and cross the ocean.) 





  
  

Scene 52 
- The Boat Ride - Jenova BIRTH -

(Cloud is inside the Shinra ship, en route to Costa Del Sol.)

         "I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?" 
         "The new President's probably the same." 
         "He's just gonna order us around anyway." 

A soldier 
         "Umm.... It's me, Aerith." 
Aerith 
         "Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?" 

Cloud 
         "...I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big." 

Aerith 
         "That was REALLY something." 
         "Hey, do you think I could get on it?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'll take you someday 
         I dunno... 

***Cloud 
         I'll take you someday 

Cloud 
         "...keep hoping." 

Aerith 
         "Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!" 
         "Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!" 

***Cloud 
         I dunno... 

Cloud 
         "It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it." 

Aerith 
         "...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it." 
         "Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship." 
<//> 

         "It won't do any good trying to stop me!" 
         "All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!" 

         "Hey, get to work!" 
         "Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!" 
         "If we do good, we could get promoted!"

A soldier 
         "Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!" 
Tifa 
         "...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform." 
         "Uniforms, soldiers, war. I hate 'em all." 
         "They take away the things and people you love..." 
         "I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah..... 
         I don't know 

***Cloud 
         Yeah....... 

Tifa 
         "You're right!" 
         "Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee...." 

***Cloud 
         I don't know 

Tifa 
         "...Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a 
little." 
         "Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not..." 
<//> 

         "Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!" 
         "A seaman's gotta have umph!" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'm tired.... 
         Something's missing 
         Leave me alone 

***Cloud 
         I'm tired.... 

         "I got just the perfect this! 'Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink 
for seamen!" 
         "Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'll take it 
         No thanks 

***Cloud 
         I'll take it 

         "Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor." 
         "This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha!" 

(HP/MP restored) 

***Cloud 
         No thanks 

         "Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!"

***Cloud

         "Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol." 
         "When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. 
Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan..." 

A soldier 
         "....... ...It's me. Red XIII." 
Red XIII 
         "I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught." 
         "Humans only look at appearances anyway." 
         "Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being." 
         "It's pretty hard standing on two feet..." 

(Cloud goes downstairs.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey, Cloud, did you see Barret?" 
         "I hope he's not doing anything stupid..."

(Cloud goes back up to the deck, where he finds Barret, dressed like 
Popeye, peering in a bay window at Rufus and Heidegger.) 

Barret 
         "Look, Cloud. It' Rufus and Heidegger." 
         "They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em..." 
         "Ummmmmm..... Gmmmmmm....." 
         "How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that?" 
         "Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge....... Jessie.....!" 
         "Gggggggh.... Ggggh.....! Ggggggggghhh!!" 

(He runs away and clenches his fists in anger)

Barret 
         "God!! I can't take it anymore!" 
         "I'm gonna settle things here and now...." 

(A siren begins to sound.) 

         "Emergency alert! Reports of a suspicious character found! Those 
not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!" 
         "I repeat. Suspicious character found on board! Those not on 
detail, search the ship. Report when found!" 

Barret 
         "Damn, did they find us?" 
         "Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean.... Tifa and the 
others!?" 

(He turns to Cloud) 

Barret 
         "Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!" 

(They hurry to the main deck. Everyone is gathered there.) 

Tifa 
         "Everyone all right!?" 

Barret 
         "You all right!?" 

Aerith 
         "Huh?" 

Tifa 
         "Everyone's here... right?" 

Barret 
         "Hey, wait." 
         "You don't think that suspicious character is...." 

         "Sephiroth!?" 

Tifa 
         "Really!?" 

Barret 
         "How the hell am I supposed to know!?" 

Cloud 
         "....Let's find out." 

Red XIII 
         "It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?" 

(The PLAYER chooses a party here- once again, I took Aerith and Tifa. 
Everyone is now in their normal clothes.) 

Cloud 
         ".....Sephiroth......." 
         "........All right, let's go!" 

(They travel down to the engine room. Dead or dying people are strewn all 
over.) 

         "....the Engine Room... a suspicious..... character..." 
         "No... there's no way.... that...... not a human..... That 
thing's not human....." 

(In the engine room, they see a captain standing before a control panel.)

Cloud 
         "Is it........ Sephiroth?" 

(The captain turns, slowly.... then falls over, dead.) 

Cloud 
         "No... not Sephiroth!" 

         "........After a long sleep..." 

(They all look around for the source of the voice.) 

         "...the time..." 
         "...time has....... come....." 

Aerith 
         "Look, Cloud!!" 

(The figure of Sephiroth arises where the captain stood.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth! You're alive!" 

         "........Who are you?" 

Cloud 
         "You don't remember me!? I'm Cloud!" 

         "Cloud..." 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?" 

         "...the time..... is now......" 

Cloud 
         "What are you saying!? Be more..."

(The figure of Sephiroth rises, then crashes into Cloud and the others, 
sending them to the floor. It soars skyward.) 

(Boss battle with Jenova-BIRTH) 

(A pulsating limb of Jenova, leftover from the battle, lies on the floor.) 

Tifa 
         "I've seen this somewhere... before." 

(Cloud bends) 

Cloud 
         "...Jenova. The arm of Jenova." 

Aerith 
         "Jenova... With this thing?" 

(The arm vanishes.) 

Cloud 
         "So it WAS Sephiroth." 

Tifa 
         "He said something about it being time for something." 

Cloud 
         "......Time...is now?" 

Aerith 
         "Hmmm... I don't get it." 
         "Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'll try 
         Too much trouble 

***Cloud 
         I'll try 

Cloud 
         "I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining." 

(He steps away) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could 
become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago." 
         "Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra." 

(He turns) 

Cloud 
         "And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth." 

(He walks forward) 

Cloud 
         "He was carrying Jenova with him." 
         "...This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the 
Promised Land with his mother, Jenova." 
         "....I guess that's about it." 
<//> 

(A voice comes over the intercom) 

         "Dock workers-- We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. 
Prepare for docking." 

Aerith 
         "Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore..." 

(All leave but Cloud. He pauses at the doorway and turns back.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth..... is alive..." 
         "The Promised Land.... Does it really exist...?" 

(He leaves the engine room.) 





  
  

Scene 53 
- Landing At Costa Del Sol - 

(On the world map, we see the Shinra ship dock at Costa Del Sol. Everyone 
leaves the ship.)

Barret 
         "Damn! Sure is hot here!" 
         "But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this 
sailor suit." 
         "Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!" 

Aerith 
         "Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor
suit. He looked so cute." 

Barret 
         ".....What'ya mean " cute " ?"

Tifa 
         "Right... well, uh..." 
         "Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?" 
         "Right, Cloud?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I guess 
         Keep your mind on Sephiroth 

***Cloud 
         I guess 

Cloud 
         "Ahhh.... You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow." 

Barret 
         "The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most 
comfortable, so shu'up!" 

***Cloud 
         Keep your mind on Sephiroth 

Cloud 
         "Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth." 
         "I'm going on ahead." 

Barret 
         "Hmmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around 
wastin' time." 
         "I'm going to skip this resort!" 
<//> 

Red XIII 
         "...puff...puff..." 
         "Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose." 

Cloud 
         "All right. We'll take a break here and then head off." 
         "Don't wander too far off." 

Barret 
         "I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?" 

Red XIII 
         "It looks like my mane got messed up." 
         "I'm going to rest somewhere cool." 

(Everyone leaves the dock.) 
  
  

(A helicopter hovers over the dock. It lands on an elevated pad near the 
water. Rufus and Heidegger get off the ship. Two sailors begin working on 
the helicopter.) 

         "What a long boat ride that was!!" 

Rufus 
         "Hmmm...... Good work everyone....." 

Heidegger 
         "Gya, Heh, heh..., ha!! Hurry up with that!" 

         "Yes, sir!!" 

(Rufus and Heidegger walk to the center of the dock.) 

Rufus 
         "I heard Sephiroth was on board." 

Heidegger 
         ".....Yes." 

(Rufus turns to Heidegger.) 

Rufus 
         "And it seems Cloud and the
others were on board, too." 

Heidegger 
         "....Yes." 

(Rufus flips his hair back) 

Rufus 
         "They all slipped through...... You messed up big this time, 
Heidegger." 

Heidegger 
         "I'm ashamed of myself." 

Rufus 
         "Is that all you can do...?" 
         "Give one word answers and apologize for everything?" 

(Heidegger cowers) 

         "Ready for departure, sir!!" 

(Rufus walks toward the helicopter.) 

Rufus 
         ".....Do something. I'll be expecting results." 

(Rufus continues to the helicopter. As soon as he is out of sight, 
Heidegger begins beating up anyone in sight on the dock, throwing sailors 
into the ocean. The helicopter takes off.) 








Scene 54 
- Hojo On The Beach - 

People in Costa Del Sol 

         "Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!" 
         "Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents in that plane and I'll 
put one in your head!" 
         "Da plane, da plane!! That's something you'll never be able to do 
in your lifetime." 
         "So you just watch from a distance... and wish." 

         "He's quite handsome, isn't he?......" 
         "Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you." 
         "I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He 
even looks good in a double-breasted suit." 

         "Rufus complimented me on my job!" 
         "Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work." 

Shinra manager 
         "Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!" 
         "I mean it. I'm really gonna quit!!" 

(He runs to the edge of the water) 

Shinra manager 
         "Heidegger's such an idiot!!" 
         "And Rufus, acting all big!!" 
         "God, that sure felt good...." 

         "Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear." 
         "Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!" 
         "Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the 
transport ship." 
         "That's tough for both of us." 

         "What a fluffy bed...... feels so great...." 

         "...SNORE...SNORE..." 
         "Geez my lower back's killing me!" 
         "Y, yes...sir!!" 
         "How do you do! I'm the Manager." 
         "Nice to meet you." 
         "Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night." 
         "Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself." 

         "Say, aren't you bored?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Not that much 
         Yeah, we fight a lot

         Where's the inn? 
         Where're the stores? 
         Show me around town 

***Cloud 
         Where's the inn? 

         "Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the 
city." 

***Cloud 
         Where're the stores? 

         "If you're not looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's." 

***Cloud 
         Show me around town 

         "Wait a minute. I'm going to look for my guidebook." 
         "It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a 
prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages." 
         "Come on!! I don't care about that." 
         "If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of 
beautiful women." 
         "You wouldn't happen to be... rich?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Oh yeah... 
         Well, not so 

***Cloud 
         Oh yeah... 

         "You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking." 
         "But I'll tell you just in case." 
         "After relaxing in Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a 
rich and exciting place to play!" 

***Cloud 
         Well, not so 

         "I thought so." 
         "Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer." 
<//> 
         "Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an 
amusement park." 
         "But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains 
and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it." 
         "But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once." 
<//> 

         "We're all headin' over to the Gold Saucer now." 
         "We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races." 
         "Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard." 

         "Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year." 
         "I'm sick of surfing." 

         "You want drink? Iz ok. You take time." 

         "...huff...puff... I can't stand hot places..." 

         "......HIC... Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now." 

Mukki 
         "I really like this town."

you."

         "( That's 1,2... 4 fishes all together... not bad."

meet." (sells weapons) 

         "Shall we play our hand around here?" 

         "Not yet. Remember, no compromises." 

         "You're right. After all, this trip was expensive." 

         "But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up." 

         "Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to 
approach." 

         "I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes." 

         "Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have." 

         "I heard. That big dog talks like a human." 
         "That's cool... but it's weird." 

Red XIII 
         "Hm, that's interesting." 
         "It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to." 
         "You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my

(Barret is in the bathroom, wearing his sailor suit and posing in front of 
the mirror. Cloud bangs on the door) 

Barret 
         "Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, awright?"

over the restroom." 
         "He's been in there moaning ever since." 
         "I don't know what I'm gonna do.."

Barret 
         "Yo, Cloud! Still too early, ain't it?"

by beautiful women.)

<CHOICE> 
         Who, Hojo...? 
         That girl in the bikini......?

Cloud 
         "Is that man over there, Hojo?" 

Tifa 
         "Go over and talk to him." 

***Cloud 
         That girl in the bikini......? 

Cloud 
         "Not a bad view...." 

Tifa 
         "What're you looking at?" 
         "That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here. Go 
talk to him!"

(He goes over to him) 

         "God!! What do you want?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I want to talk with that man 
         Is that Hojo? 

***Cloud 
         I want to talk with that man 

         "(Hey, who do you think you are?)" 
         "Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you." 

***Cloud 
         Is that Hojo? 

         "(What's his problem?)" 
         "Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!" 
         "Professor... someone's here to see you, sir." 
<//> 

Hojo 
         "I'm busy right now." 

         ".....But. Too bad." 

Hojo 
         "Oh, I remember you all now." 
         "Yes, yes. I remember now." 

(Hojo sits up) 

Hojo 
         "It's been a long time, Cloud." 

Cloud 
         "Hojo....." 

Hojo 
         "Sometimes you just gotta do something like this." 

Cloud 
         "....What are you doing?" 

Hojo 
         "It should be obvious. I'm getting a tan." 

Cloud 
         "Answer me!" 

Hojo 
         "Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal." 

Cloud 
         "You mean Sephiroth?" 

Hojo 
         "Did you see him?" 
         "I see..... Ha! Ha!" 

(He stands up) 

Cloud 
         "What is it?" 

Hojo 
         "Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis......." 
         "Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?" 
         "Or that you had to visit some place?......" 

Cloud 
         "I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at!" 
         "To beat him and put an end to all this!" 

Hojo 
         "I see...... This could be interesting." 
         "Were you in SOLDIER? ....Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my 
guinea pig?" 

(Cloud draws his sword) 

Hojo 
         "Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?" 

Tifa 
         "Stop, Cloud! I know how you feel, but you mustn't." 

(He puts it away) 

Hojo 
         "Ha! Ha! Ha!...." 

(He gets off his beach chair and looks at Aerith) 

Hojo 
         "Say, aren't you the 'Ancient?'" 

Aerith 
         "I'm Aerith. The least you can do is remember my name." 
         "I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo....." 
         "I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me." 

Hojo 
         "Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?" 

Aerith 
         "You didn't know? She died." 

(He looks away) 

Hojo 
         "......I see." 

Aerith 
         "Professor Hojo...." 
         "Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have 
the same blood?" 

Hojo 
         "......mumble....mumble..... head west...." 

Aerith 
         "He's mumbling slowly.... That must mean he's hiding something!" 

(Hojo gets back on his beach chair) 

Hojo 
         "................." 

Tifa 
         "Hey! Answer us!!" 

(He is silent) 

Cloud 
         ".......It's no use. It's no go." 
  

         "He never takes off his lab coat even in thie heat. I guess 
that's the mark of an intellectual." 

         "I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!" 

         "Yipes! Help!!" 
         "....breath.... breath...! Kind of takes your breath away, don't 
it!?" 

         "If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some 
'Soft.'" 
         "At least that's what they always say, don't they?" 
         "Be prepared, and you'll never fear." 
         "Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! 
Pretty good, huh?" 
  




  
  
  
Scene 55 
- Mountain Pass - Another Reactor - 

(They leave Costa del Sol and head south, until they reach a mountain 
pass. A man is resting there) 

         "Whew!" 
         "Hey!" 
         "You're actually talking to me."

Cloud 
         "What is it?" 

         "I just passed a guy in a black cape back there." 
         "I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he 
ignored me!"

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth...." 

Aerith 
         "There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?" 

Tifa 
         "Let's hurry on."


(They continue on, past the mountain pass, passing a Mako reactor and 
crossing many mine-car tracks, until they reach a bridge. The other two 
are there.) 

Red XIII 
         "Wha? Oh, it's you." 
         "There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates 
this bridge." 
         "Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment." 

(The camera moves over to show the hut.) 

         "The shack is here!! (^^);"

         "Come on, Cloud, don't let it get to you. Let's see... this is

Aerith

(Cloud continues. Along the way, he climbs a pile of rubble and comes 
across a hidden room. A miner lives there.) 
  
         "Hey! How'd you ever wind up around here?" 
         "Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!" 
         "Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal 
mining town!" 
         "They say there were more jobs than you could shake a..." 
         "Well, you get the picture!" 
         "Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer... 
everything's out of work." 
         "Got no job... I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left 
for me is to just live in this hole all day." 

(Can't help? Not so. Cloud grabs some treasure from his room and 
continues. Crossing a long suspended bridge across a deep gorge, he 
arrives in North Corel.) 








  Scene 56 
- North Corel - Barret's Hometown - 

(Cloud arrives in North Corel. Barret approaches several people there, 
some dressed in mining outfits. One steps forward and punches him, then 
steps back.) 

         "Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again." 

         "They kick you out of another town or somethin'?" 
         "You destroy everything you touch."  

         "You got a lot of balls comin' back here!" 
         "Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into 
a garbage heap!" 

         "Why doncha say something!?" 
         "Or did ya forget what you done here already?"

(Barret sighs) 

Barret 
         "...I'm sorry...." 

         "^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort." 

         "Don't waste your time talkin' to the Techno-freak!" 

(The other people disperse. Barret returns to the party) 

Barret 
         "You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was... destroyed..." 

(He runs away.) 

People in North Corel 

         "YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!" 

         "The next train's coming in soon." 

         "Grandpa used to be a coal train engineer." 
         "He still can't kick his old habits from then." 

         "Get out of the way!!" 
         "The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by 
collecting junk!" 

         "Please buy something! Anything will do!" (sells items)

right?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I wouldn't know 
         That's right 

***Cloud 
         I wouldn't know 

         "Really...? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading 
towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool." 

***Cloud 
         That's right 

         "I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, '0' 
oughtta be perfect." 
<//> 

         "Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?" 

         "Because of them...... ugh my husband got into that accident.... 
He used to be such a strong man..." 

         "How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost 
everything...?" 
         "To hell with the Mako reactor!" 

(Cloud goes to the Ropeway station. The others are waiting there.) 

Aerith 
         "Barret, what happened?" 

Barret 
         "Sorry." 

Cloud 
         "What happened?" 

Barret 
         "My hometown used to be around here." 

Red XIII 
         "What do you mean, 'used to'?"

Barret 
         "It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years." 

Aerith 
         "But how could those people say those terrible things?" 

Barret 
         "An' it's my fault. ALL my fault." 

(The scene fades. It changes to a shot of Corel, many years ago. Idyllic. 
A cat and dog play with a young child. Barret speaks over the scene.) 

Barret 
         "Corel was always a coal mining
town." 
         "It's so dusty, but calm and so poor... a real small town, this 
one." 
         "That's the first time I ever heard the word "Mako reactor" 
mentioned since that time..." 

(The scene changes again. We are now at the village headman's house. Many 
people are gathered there, including Barret. Scarlet, with two of her 
bodyguards, is standing near the door as if she just walked in. Dyne is 
sitting on the couch. The village headman walks over to him.) 

Village headman 
         "What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne." 

Dyne 
         "I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to 
talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!" 
         "Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and 
theirs before them, risked their lives for it." 
         "We have no right to throw it all away so easily!" 

Barret 
         "But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of 
the times." 

Scarlet 
         "Right, everything is Mako, now." 
         "It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your 
livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed." 

Barret 
         "Listen. Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore." 

(Dyne makes pleading gestures, then slumps forward.) 

Dyne 
         "I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!" 
         "But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!" 

(The village headman puts his hand on Dyne's shoulder.) 

Village Headman 
         "Dyne... you've got to understand." 

(Dyne looks at the village headman, then at Barret. He holds his head and 
starts to cry. The scene fades darkly, but not to black. Barret speaks.) 

Barret 
         "That's how the Corel Reactor was built.... and completed." 
         "We all thought it would bring us an easier life."

(The scene fades to black. When it fades in again, we see the town of 
Corel in flames. One person falls four stories from a water tower. As the 
camera pans across the town, we see various townsfolk panicking, then 
dying.) 

Barret 
         "It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days." 
         "Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops." 
         "All the townspeople........ All my relatives......... 
Everyone...... Everything......" 

(The scene fades to black. We are now back at the Ropeway station. Cloud 
walks around to Barret.) 

Cloud 
         "Shinra troops? What for!?" 

(Barret turns away) 

Barret 
         "There was an explosion at a reactor." 
         "Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a 
rebel faction." 

Tifa 
         "That's so terrible!" 

Barret 
         "Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't 
forgive myself." 
         "Never should have gone along with the building of the reactor..." 

Tifa 
         "Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra 
made back then." 

Barret 
         "That's way... that's why I get so pissed off!!" 
         "Not only did they take advantage of me... But I lost my wife, 
Myrna, too..." 

(The ticket vendor at the Ropeway station suddenly speaks) 

         "Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and 
get on!" 
         "Ride the Ropeway?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Go on 
         Don't go on 

***Cloud

***Cloud

Barret 
         "Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids..." 

(Cloud and the others board the Ropeway and ride to the Gold Saucer..) 








Scene 57 
- Gold Saucer - Cait Sith, The God Of Luck -

(Cloud and the others take the Ropeway to the Gold Saucer. FMV sequence 
as the Ropeway approaches. It is a huge golden structure, resembling 
something out of Star Wars, dotted with lights that shine and strobe 
happily. The Ropeway pulls into the station and Cloud gets off.) 

Chocobo 
         "Welcome to the Gold Saucer." 

(Cloud speaks to the ticket seller.) 

         "Welcome to the Gold Saucer." 
         "Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase 
a lifetime pass for 30000 gil." 

<CHOICE> 
         Pay 3000 gil 
         Pay 30000 gil 
         Don't pay 

***Cloud 
         Pay 30000 gil 

         "Thank you very much." 
         "If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the 
park... as long as you don't lose it." 
<//> 

         "Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must 
pay with GP." 
         "Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold 
Saucer." 
         "GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the 
Chocobo Races." 
         "Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful." 
         "Please enjoy yourselves." 

(Cloud enters the Gold Saucer.) 

Aerith 
         "Wow! Let's have fun!" 

(She turns to Barret, who is facing the wall.) 

Aerith 
         "I know this isn't the right time to do this." 

(She walks over to him) 

Aerith 
         "Hey, Barret, cheer up!" 

(He takes a step away from her.) 

Barret 
         "I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes'
leave me alone." 

(She goes over to him and looks at him.) 

Aerith 
         "Really? That's too bad." 

(She runs over to Cloud) 

Aerith 
         "Let's go!" 

(Tifa goes over to Aerith) 

Tifa 
         "...whisper... whisper... (Wasn't that a little harsh, Aerith!?)" 

Aerith 
         "...whisper... whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)" 

Tifa 
         "...whisper... (You think so...?)" 

Aerith 
         "Of course!" 

(Aerith runs over to Barret again) 

Aerith 
         "We're gonna go play..." 

(Barret starts waving his arms) 

Barret 
         "So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$!" 
         "Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!" 

(He runs and jumps in the Wonder Square portal.) 

Aerith 
         "...I think he's mad." 

Tifa 
         "He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now." 

(Cloud chooses who he wants to take with him into the Saucer. I chose 
Aerith.)

People in the Event Square 

         "What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?" 

         "Geez, you're a real bummer. Why don't you leave us alone?" 

         "We put on a really unusual show here. It's not on today, but 
come back again sometime and see it." 

People in the Speed Square 

Man 
         "Hey boy." 


Cloud 
         "Boy..." 

Man 
         "How is it? You having fun?" 
         "Mmm, so you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy."

Dio 
         "Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio." 
         "Just call me 'Dio'." 

Cloud 
         ".........(Not even listening)" 

Dio 
         "By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I know what it is 
         What is it? 

***Cloud 
         What is it?

Dio 
         "Ha ha ha.... that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not 
good to lie. You can't fool me." 

Cloud 
         "Why d'you ask me?" 

Dio 
         "Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had 
a 'Black Materia.'" 
         "I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both 
about the same age." 

Cloud 
         "Did he happen to have... a Black Cape..." 

Dio 
         "Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'." 

Cloud 
         "Where did he go!?" 

Dio 
         "Ha ha ha, I have no idea." 
         "Well then." 
         "I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy." 
         "You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display 
there." 
         "Ha, ha ha." 

(He leaves.) 

         "We have to be careful of these steps." 
         "What...? A lot of things..." 

         "First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess 
on the attacks...... mumble, mumble....."

are going PHEW PHEW amd you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, 
isn't it?" 
         "Oh, to shoot, hit the O button. And, the Bar that's shown on the 
left side of the screen is the Power Meter." 
         "When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll 
only go BRM and become weak. So be careful."

People in the Battle Square 

         "I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again." 

(Cloud goes to the Wonder Square. When he arrives, a... stuffed cat riding 
a giant moogle approaches.)

         "Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?" 
         "How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A 
happy future!" 
         "Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction!" 
         "Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's..." 

(The PLAYER names Cait Sith) 

Cloud 
         "You can only read the future?" 

Cait Sith 
         "You kidding!? I can find missing things, missing people, 
anything!" 

Cloud 
         "Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Sephiroth, right?" 
         "Okay, here goes!!" 

(He does a little fortune-telling dance...) 

Cloud 
         "...Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune." 
         "Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen 
by summer. ...wait... what's this?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Huh? Let me try again." 

(He does the dance again) 

Cloud 
         "Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is... blue?" 
         "...Forget it." 

Cait Sith 
         "Wait, wait give me another chance!" 
         "Wait! Let me try it again!" 

(He does a super-fast dance!) 

Cloud 
         "...What the!?" 

Aerith 
         "What?" 

Cloud 
         "What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear." 

Cait Sith 
         "I don't know if it's good OR bad..." 
         "This's the first time I ever got something like THIS." 

(He nods) 

Cait Sith 
         "Then shall we?" 

Aerith 
         "What are you talking about?" 

Cait Sith 
         "As a fortune teller, I can't help but think about this." 
         "If I don't see what it leads to, I won't be able to relax. 
That's why I'm going with you!" 

Aerith 
         "What are we going to do, Cloud?" 

Cait Sith 
         "I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!" 

(He joins the party!) 

Cloud 
         "H... hey!"

People in the Wonder Square 

         "Come now, no running!" 

         "They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the 
attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'." 
         "They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square 
games or at the Chocobo Races." 

         "You have (number of GP)." 
         "Exchange your GP for prizes here. Want to exchange?" 

         "Nope. I'm not quitting until I clear this!"

         "Hyuuuu, BAM, BAM, BAM..." 
         "Oh man, I just gotta shout." 

         "...Don't worry 'bout me. Go ahead and play." 

         "I get so caught up in these..." 

         "Back there..." 

(Here you can play a game of Mog House.) 

         This is Mog's House. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog. 
         The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog. 

(Mog comes out of his house) 

         This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. ...that's about 23 in 
human years. He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate. 
         But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how 
to fly. 

(He climbs up on a mushroom) 

         Even though Mog trains hard everyday... He still can't seem to 
get off the ground... 

(Mog flaps his wings, leaps off the mushroom... and lands flat on the 
ground.) 

         Looks like he's still got a long way to go... 
         Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing 
the O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut. 
         But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat. 

(Here you feed him some Kupo nuts... 5 to be exact. He jumps up on the 
mushroom again) 

         Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it. 

(He flaps his wings, jumps off, and starts flying! He flies around for a 
while, then comes in for a landing.) 

         He did it! He's flying! Now he's finally become a full-fledged 
Mog. 

(Mog walks back into his house and shuts the door.) 

         Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and 
goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams... 

(Another Mog comes into Mog's front yard.) 

         Oh?... What's this? Here comes a female Mog! 

(She knocks on Mog's door. He answers it, and when he sees Miss Mog, he 
starts jumping up and down.) 

         Seems like he likes her too... 

(She sits on Mog's mailbox. Mog runs around to the mushroom) 

         Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him 
out with a few Kupo nuts. 

(You feed him three nuts. Mog jumps up onto the mushroom...) 

         Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it. 

(He flaps his wings and flies around the yard.) 

         He's flying!! Mog was able to do it!! 

(Mog lands on the mushroom) 

         She must have fallen for his graceful flying form. 

(The screen fades to black.) 

         Sometime later... 

(Mog's house fades back in. Mog comes out of his house.) 

         Looks like things are going good with his new Mog-friend. Time 
for a quiet date in the forest. 
         Her name is Mag. She is a good-natured Mog. 

(Mog and Mag walk off into the woods.)

         Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag. May you have lots 
of healthy Mogs! 

(Fourteen baby mogs run out of the house and follow Mog and Mag.) 

         Uh, no worries there, I guess... 

(One baby Mog runs back on to the screen and waves goodbye at you.) 

         ~FIN~ 

         "Hmmm...I'm impressed. Thanks for showing me it." 
         "Here, take this." 

(The guy in front of the Mog House game gives you 30 GP.) 

People in the Chocobo Square

         "I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only." 

         "You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For

combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5."

         "No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. 
It all comes down to insight and luck."

rank tickets." 
         "Of course, the higher the rank, the better the item ticket. Hey,

connections."

         "Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?" 

         "That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condtion and strengths." 

         "Hmm, if you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's 
easy..." 

         "Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the 
Chocobo's strength." 
         "but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's 
personality." 
         "If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect 
other things."

  Scene 58 
- Barret's Crime -

(Cloud goes to the Battle Square. When he arrives, he sees a guard 
standing at the foot of the steps.) 

Cloud 
         "!!" 

(The guard falls over, dead.)

Cloud 
         "Mm!?" 

(The party runs over to him. Cloud checks for a pulse) 

Cloud 
         "Dead....." 

Aerith 
         "What!? Why?" 

(Cloud looks up, then runs into the Battle Square lobby.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud!? Where are you going?" 

(The others follow him. When they arrive in the lobby, they find the floor 
covered in blood and debris. There are many bodies scattered around.) 

Cloud 
         "Did Sephiroth do this!?" 

(He checks a body) 

Cloud 
         "No... it's not him... They're all shot... Sephiroth would never 
use a gun..." 

         "Ugh, ugggh." 

(A body in the corner moves slightly. They all run over to him) 

Cloud 
         "Hey, what happened!" 

         "Ugh... ugh... a man with a gun... on his arm...." 

Aerith 
         "It can't be!?" 

         "Hold it right there! And stay quiet!!" 

(They all turn to the door. Dio and two guards walk in.) 

Dio 
         "Did you guys do this!?" 

Cloud 
         "N... no, it wasn't us!" 

Dio 
         "I must've been wrong..." 

(Cait Sith turns to Cloud) 

Cait Sith 
         "Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly." 

(Cait Sith runs into the arena. Aerith follows.) 

Cloud 
         "H... hey!" 

(Cloud runs after them. The two guards follow.) 

Dio 
         "Hold them!" 

(They arrive in the arena. There is no way out. Dio emerges on a high 
platform.) 

Dio 
         "That's as far as you go." 

(He gestures with his hand. Cait Sith checks a door. It's locked.) 

Cloud 
         "Wait, listen to..." 

(Cait Sith comes back) 

Cait Sith 
         "Cloud..." 

(Three huge robots leap into the arena and approach them. The screen fades 
to black. When it fades in again, we are at the "Gateway to Heaven." It is 
just a hole in the floor. One of the robots is holding Cloud over it.)

Dio 
         "One more to go." 

         "Yes." 

Cloud 
         "Hey! Pay attention!!" 

Dio 
         "There's no need to listen. Pay for your crime down below!!" 
         "Do it!" 

         "Yes."


(A guard presses a button, opening the 'Gateway.' The robot, still 
holding Cloud, leaps down. The screen fades.) 








  Scene 59 
- Corel Prison -

(Cloud and the others land in the prison below the Gold Saucer.) 

Aerith 
         "You all right?" 

Cloud 
         "Where are we?" 

Cait Sith 
         "A desert prison... Corel Prison..." 

Cloud 
         "A desert prison?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert... surrounded 
entirely by quicksand." 
         "I heard that once you get in, you never get out...." 
         "But, there was one special exception..." 

(The camera pans down. We see Barret standing near some pipes. There is a 
man lying face down on the ground near him.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey!! Barret!!" 

(They all run over to him) 

Cloud 
         "Barret..." 

(Barret turns) 

Cloud 
         "Did he really....." 

(Barret steps back. Cloud steps forward.) 

Barret 
         "Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with." 

(He turns away) 

Barret 
         "Jes' leave me alone...." 

(He runs off) 

Cait Sith 
         "Whew! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous..." 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, what should we do? Barret's not his normal self." 

(Cloud checks the dead man) 

Cloud 
         "This one's been shot too..."

People in Corel Prison 

         "Wo-ho! Welcome to Corel
Prison." 

         "Ha ha ha" 

         "I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely 
dangerous." 
         "It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave, it'll 
swallow ya." 
         "I hear tell, some of them never make it out... the best thing is 
to stay out of the desert entirely."

         "Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not a one of 'em will tell 
you the truth." 
         "Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of 
them."

         "This place is heaven." 
         "This place is heaven." 
         "This place is heaven." 
         "Man with a gun on his arm?" 
         "Never heard of him." 
         "Never heard of him." 
         "Never heard of him." 
         "You wanna see the Boss?" 
         "Go Southwest and you'll meet him." 
         "You'll meet him." 
         "You'll meet him." 
         "Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk." 
         "Don't walk." 
         "Don't walk." 
         "There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. 
No way." 
         "No way." 
         "No way." 

         "This elevator will talk you to the top..."

         "The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race." 
         "But, it's not as easy as you rookies think."

  Scene 60 
- Gun Arm -

(Cloud enters a small shack on the edge of the prison. As he enters, we 
see that it is the same house we saw during Barret's story, only it is 
rundown and sooty, ravaged by fire. Barret bursts in the door.)

Barret 
         "Didn't I tell you not to come here!?" 

(He raises his gun-arm.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Ju..... just hold on for a second! We just want to talk! You'll 
understand if you just hear us out!" 

(Barret fires. Cloud and the others lift their arms and try to protect 
their head, but they are not hurt. Barret continues to fire... A person 
falls to the ground. He was hiding behind the couch. They lower their arms. 
Barret turns away.)


Barret 
         "Didn't want none of ya to get involved..." 

(Cloud shrugs. The party members you left at the Gold Saucer rush in.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey that's Cloud's line! '...It's too dangerous, I can't let you 
get involved...' blah, blah, blah..." 

Tifa 
         "Yeah. We're already involved in this." 
         "We saw you and hurried here. So come on Barret, just tell us 
what's going on." 

Barret 
         "You guys..." 

Red XIII 
         "I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man 
with a gun-arm. ...Was that you?" 

(Barret shakes his head quickly, then looks up.) 

Barret 
         "There's another.... another man that got a gun grafted inta one 
of his arms... It was four years ago...." 

(The screen fades white. When it comes in again, we are at the train 
tracks that join the Mako reactor they passed on the way to Corel.) 

         I remember... I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor 
being built. 

(Barret and Dyne come across the train tracks when the village headman 
rushes up from the direction of North Corel.) 

         "Barret! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's 
Shinra soldiers!" 

Barret 
         "What!!!?" 

(Barret and Dyne leap off the track and run to the cliff's edge. They see 
their village, in flames. Black smoke rises into the sky. Barret raises 
his arms and trembles.)

Barret 
         "What the hell happened? ......." 

(Barret falls to his knees. Dyne looks away. Barret punches the ground 
and Dyne shakes his shoulder.) 

Dyne 
         "Hey, Barret! It's not over yet!" 
         "Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!" 

(The scene shifts back to the train tracks. Four Shinra soldiers come 
onto the tracks and aim their guns at the village headman.) 

         "Barret! Dyne! Protect the village!" 

(They fire. The village headman falls.) 

Barret 
         "Hmp!! Old man!!" 

(They start firing at Barret and Dyne. Dyne leaps under the tracks, but 
Barret is left dancing his way though their fire.) 

Dyne 
         "C'mon, Barret! We gotta hurry!" 

(He runs off.) 

Barret 
         "Krggh!!" 

(He follows Dyne. When he reaches him, they stop, standing at the edge of 
a high cliff. Scarlet enters and stands by the guards, still firing.) 

Dyne 
         "Barret!! You stay here!!" 

Scarlet 
         "Kyaa haa, ha!!" 
         "You can shoot all day and never hit them with an aim like that." 

Barret 
         "Shu'up!!" 

(Scarlet knocks one of the guards off the tracks. The rest stop firing 
and face her.) 

Scarlet 
         "Haa, ha, ha!! Stop playing around and cover me!!" 

(They surround Scarlet and resume firing at Barret and Dyne.) 

Dyne 
         "Watch out!!" 

(They hit Dyne, who falls from the cliff. Barret grabs his left arm just in 
time to save him from falling.) 

Barret 
         "Dyne!! Hang on!!" 
         "Lissen to me!! You're comin' back the the village, hear!!?" 

Dyne 
         "Yeah... I ain't lettin' go..." 
         "You're comin' back... Everyone's waitin' for ya..." 
         "Eleanor... and Marlene... They all waitin' on us..."

(FMV sequence. The guards continue to fire. Their fire sweeps along the 
edge of the cliff, hitting Dyne's and Barret's arms. Dyne falls from 
Barret's grasp, into the chasm. The scene fades back to the house in Corel 
Prison.) 

Barret 
         "From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more." 

(He looks down) 

Barret 
         "...I was depressed for a while." 

(He straightens) 

Barret 
         "But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted 
in." 

(He turns away) 

Barret 
         "Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took 
everything away..." 

(He faces the others again) 

Barret 
         "Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got 
the same operation as me." 
         "But, his was the left arm..." 

Cloud 
         "....." 

Aerith 
         "But... Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?" 

Tifa 
         "Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too." 
         "He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra." 

Barret 
         "...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can 
rest in peace." 
         "An' that's why, I gotta go alone." 

Cloud 
         "Do whatever you want... Is that what you want to hear?" 
         "Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm 
gonna have nightmares." 

Aerith 
         "Barret, this isn't the end." 
         "Weren't you going to save the Planet?" 

Barret 
         "Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now." 

Tifa 
         "...That's all right. I'm not so different from you." 

Aerith 
         "That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret." 

Cloud 
         "So there it is, Barret. So I guess it'll be Barret, me, 
and......" 

(Cloud chooses a third party member.) 
  






  
  Scene 61 
- Dyne - Broken Trust -

(Cloud, Barret, and the others travel north from Corel Prison to the 
junkyard. At the north side of the junkyard, they meet Dyne, who his 
shooting his gun-arm at random things. The ground is littered with debris, 
and the gives way at a cliff's edge into a deep gorge. There are two 
crosses, one large and one small, crudely stuck into the ground by the 
cliff's edge.) 

Barret 
         "...Dyne .... Is that you?"

(Dyne looks up) 

Dyne 
         "Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years..." 

(Dyne comes toward Barret. He is limping.) 

Dyne 
         "A voice I'll never forget..." 

Barret 
         "I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday..." 
         "I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation." 
         "Listen to me Dyne. I want to..." 

(Barret walks toward Dyne. Dyne fires at him and he stops.) 

Dyne 
         "What's that? ...I hear her voice." 

Barret 
         "......?" 

Dyne 
         "I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate 
your rotten guts." 

(He looks down.) 

Dyne 
         "That's why I didn't hunt you down..." 

Barret 
         "I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me." 
         "But... What're you doin' in a place like this?" 
         "Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?" 

(Dyne lifts his good arm) 

Dyne 
         "....Why!? The hell do you care for!?" 

(He points at Barret) 

Dyne 
         "Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people 
of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?" 

(He lifts his other arm.) 

Dyne 
         "I don't CARE what the reason is!" 

(He lowers it) 

Dyne 
         "All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left 
is a world of despair and emptiness..." 

Barret 
         "........" 

Dyne 
         "You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you." 

(He limps away from Barret.) 

Dyne 
         "'Cause I want to destroy everything." 

(He shoots at something.) 

Dyne 
         "The people of this city." 

(He limps back and shoots again.) 

Dyne 
         "This city itself." 

(He shoots at Barret's feet three times. Barret cringes with each.) 

Dyne 
         "The whole world!" 

(Dyne turns away) 

Dyne 
         "I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor...... 
Marlene......" 

Barret 
         "Dyne, Marlene...... Marlene's still alive." 

(Dyne looks over his shoulder at Barret) 

Dyne 
         "........?" 

Barret 
         "I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure." 
         "That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end." 
         "That's when I found her..... ...found Marlene." 

Dyne 
         "..." 

Barret 
         "She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?" 

Dyne 
         "So...... she's still alive..." 
         "All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight." 

Barret 
         "What!?" 

(Dyne turns back toward Barret) 

Dyne 
         "Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her." 

Barret 
         "Dyne.... are you insane!?" 

Dyne 
         "Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?" 

(Dyne starts firing directly at Barret. Barret tries to block the bullets 
with his arms) 

Barret 
         "Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!" 

(Dyne stops.) 

Dyne 
         "Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then." 

(He starts firing again) 

Barret 
         "Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!" 

(The camera pans down to show Cloud again.) 

Cloud 
         "Barret!" 

Barret 
         "Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!" 

(Boss battle with Dyne) 

(Dyne falls to his knees. Barret runs toward him) 

Dyne 
         "Back!!" 

(He gets up and limps over near the cliff's edge. He leans against a 
piece of broken metal.) 

Dyne 
         "...it wasn't just my arm...... back then...." 
         "I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where I went 
wrong..." 

Barret 
         "Dyne..... I don't know either, man." 
         "Is this the only way... we can resolve this?" 

Dyne 
         "I told you... I... I want to destroy everything..." 
         "Everything... This crazy world... Even me..." 

Barret 
         "An' what about Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?" 

Dyne 
         "Think about it... Barret... How old was Marlene back then...?" 
         "Even if I did go to her now... she wouldn't even know me..." 
         "And what's more... Barret...." 

(He looks at his hands.) 

Dyne 
         "These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore..." 

(Barret looks down.) 

Barret 
         "......" 

Dyne 
         "Barret..." 

(Barret straightens. Dyne tosses something to him.) 

Dyne 
         "Give that pendant to Marlene... It was... Eleanors's... my 
wife's... memento..." 

Barret 
         "All right..." 

Dyne 
         "...wow... Marlene's... already..... 4......" 

(Dyne limps over to the cliff's edge. Many rays of sunlight break through 
the clouds overhead, striking the ground below the two crude crosses.) 

Dyne 
         "Barret.... Don't... make... .....Don't ever make Marlene..... 
cry..." 

Barret 
         "Dyne...?" 

(Barret runs forward.) 

Barret 
         "Dyne!" 

(Dyne falls backwards, his arms outstretched, off the cliff's edge.) 

Barret 
         "Dy--------ne!!" 

(He falls to his knees.) 

Barret 
         "...Dyne. Me an' you were the same..." 
         "My hands ain't any cleaner.... I shouldn't be able to carry.... 
Marlene either...." 
         "Uuuuurrrrgghh!!!" 

(The camera pans upwards, showing Barret raising his arms to the sky. The 
sun shines on the forest in the distance. The screen fades to black.) 
  
  






  Scene 62 
- Ester, Your New Manager - 

(Cloud and the others are in the truck where Mr. Coates resides.) 

Mr. Coates 
         "You want somethin'?" 

Barret 
         "I want to go up." 

Mr. Coates 
         "Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then 
win the Chocobo....." 

Barret 
         "Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak." 
         "So, I got this instead." 

(He shows Mr. Coates Dyne's pendant.) 

Mr. Coates 
         "Yeah, bull--!!" 

Barret 
         "I want to go up." 

(He nods) 

Mr. Coates 
         "R, right." 
         "Did you kill Dyne?" 
         "You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing." 
         "So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little." 
         "Dyne didn't care who anyone was......" 

(Barret grabs him by the neck.) 

Barret 
         "The hell do YOU know!!" 

Mr. Coates 
         "R... ri.... right! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. 
S, s... sorry." 

(Barret releases him. He brushes off his bright green coat.) 

Cloud 
         "Then, will you get us outta here?" 

Mr. Coates 
         "Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken." 

(He shrugs) 

Mr. Coates 
         "I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here." 
         "That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's help up there, in the 
Gold Saucer." 
         "And, only one racer can go up at a time." 

(Barret grabs him by the neck again) 

Barret 
         "Say what!?" 

Mr. Coates 
         "Nooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!" 
         "A rule's a rule. I can't change it." 
         "If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I 
can't do that!" 
         "Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal 
with Dio." 

(Barret lets him go) 

Barret 
         "Awright then." 

(He turns to Cloud) 

Barret 
         "Cloud, you go." 
         "We'll wait down here." 
         "Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!" 

Aerith 
         "Yes, good luck, Cloud." 

Mr. Coates 
         "Have you decided?" 
         "All you need now is a manager." 
         "...and register and get a Chocobo..." 

         "Hi...... I happened to hear your story." 

(Everyone turns toward the door) 

Mr. Coates 
         "Ester?" 

(Ester walks in.)

Ester 
         "I'll be your manager." 

Mr. Coates 
         "Well, I have nothing against it, but...." 
         "This is Ester. She may look kinda funny..." 
         "But there's no better manager in the races." 

Ester 
         "That's so rude..." 
         "Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud." 

Mr. Coates 
         "All right then, Cloud." 
         "I'll send you up on the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the 
details." 
  
  






  Scene 63 
- Chocobo Race - Free -

(Ester and Cloud are riding up the elevator to the Gold Saucer.) 

Ester 
         "Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You 
just concentrate on the race." 
         "Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many 
different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals." 
         "Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the 
money, some only for glory... And then there are people like you." 
         "Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo." 

<CHOICE> 
         All right 
         Not interested 

***Cloud 
         All right 

Ester 
         "Ummm... First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or 
MANUAL." 
         "In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on 
its own." 
         "But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it 
to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen." 
         "You can't really help on this one." 
         "But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow 
and you should be able to handle them." 
         "When you're riding, use the Square button to Speed Up and the X 
Button to Slow Down." 
         "But, it you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose 
its stamina really fast." 
         "And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and 
right, use the O button to get a boost of speed." 
         "Of course your stamina runs out faster though." 
         "There are some bad-tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves 
and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast." 
         "For there kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on 
Manual and slow it down." 
         "Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second 
Chocobo cross the goal line," 
         "Push the [Start] button to end the race." 
<//> 

(They arrive at the top of the elevator and enter the jockey's lounge.) 

Man 
         "You new?"

Ester 
         "Hi, Joe." 

Joe 
         "Hey, Ester, you're looking pretty as usual." 

Ester 
         "Thanks." 
         "Let me introduce you, Cloud." 
         "This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys." 

Joe 
         "Nice to meet you, Cloud." 
         "If you're with Ester, then..." 

Ester 
         "Right! He's an up and coming jockey." 
         "He's only been down here for a day and already he made it up 
here!!" 

         "What!?" 

Joe 
         "Oh, I see..." 
         "So what did you do down there?" 
         "Sorry... you're not supposed to ask about the past here..." 
         "Pretty interesting.... I have a feeling that we'll meet again." 
         "Then, until we meet again, Cloud." 

(He leaves) 

Ester 
         "I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a 
while." 

(She leaves. There is a loud tone on the intercom system.) 

         "The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the 
next race, please proceed the the paddock." 
         "I repeat..." 

(All the jockeys at the table rise and leave.) 

Ester 
         "Cloud." 

(She arrives in the lounge) 

Ester 
         "Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race." 
         "This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He won't lose easily." 
         "Oh yeah... You know how to ride one?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Uh, how was it again? 
         Yeah, I got it 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, I got it 
<//> 

Ester 
         "Then, good luck." 

(Cloud rides his Chocobo [and hopefully wins!]) 

Ester 
         "Congratulations!! Now you're home free!" 
         "Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you when you 
won." 

Dio 
         "Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must have won. And 
won a victory that I am sure you earned." 
         "I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you are victorious, I 
promise that you and all your friends will get a full pardon, and you will 
all be set free." 
         "And also, by way of apology, I prepared a little gift for you to 
use on your journey." 
         "Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a 
very busy man. Sincerely, Dio" 

Cloud 
         "A gift?" 

(The PHS rings. Cloud answers) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, isn't this great!? The assistant manager just stopped by 
and dropped off a 'buggy' for you!" 
         "Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem." 
         "OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside." 

Cloud 
         (Hmm? The letter continues...) 
         "P.S. I just recently met Sephiroth. He must have a lot of fans 
with boys your age." 
         "Why don't you get his autograph? It seems he's headed toward the 
South of the river, towards Gongaga."

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth..." 

Ester 
         "I guess this is goodbye." 
         "Yeah. Well, if you ever get your
own Chocobo, come race again." 
         "I'll take care of your registration
and everything. I'll see you again." 

(Cloud exits the Gold Saucer and drives
south on his new buggy, towards
Gongaga.) 








Scene 64 
- The Turks - Ruined Reactor - Gongaga Village - Aerith and Zack -

(Cloud and the others arrive in the Gongaga area. Cloud approaches an 
intersection along the forest path leading to the town, then stops.) 

Cloud 
         "Is someone there?" 

(The camera pans over. Reno and Rude are standing in the road.) 

Reno 
         "Hey, Rude. Who do you like?" 

(Rude turns away) 

Reno 
         "What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you 
like?" 

Rude 
         "...........Tifa." 

Reno 
         "Hmmmm......." 
         "That's a tough one." 
         "But, poor Elena. She.... you......" 

Rude 
         "No, she likes Tseng." 

Reno 
         "I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient..." 

(The camera pans back over to show Cloud.) 

Cloud 
         "What are they talking about?) 

(Elena enters, coming up behind Cloud.) 

Elena 
         "It's so stupid!" 
         "They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is 
different." 
         "Ah! Oh no!" 

(She runs over to Reno and Rude) 

Elena 
         "They're here! They're really here!" 

Reno 
         "Hmm... Then it's time..." 
         "Rude... Don't go easy on them even though they're girls." 

Rude 
         "...Don't worry, I'll do my job." 

Elena 
         "Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!" 

(She runs off) 

Reno 
         "It's been a while." 
         "Payback time for what you did in Sector 7." 

<CHOICE> 
         Sector 7? 
         Out of our way 

***Cloud 
         Sector 7? 

Reno 
         "That's sad." 

***Cloud 
         Out of our way 

Reno 
         "I don't like being taken for a fool."

<//> 

Rude 
         "That's as far as you go." 

(Boss battle with Reno and Rude) 

Aerith 
         "...How could they know we were coming here?" 

Cloud 
         "They followed us...... But there weren't any signs of it. Then, 
that means......" 

Tifa 
         "A spy!? ...No way." 

(Cloud turns away and looks up) 

Cloud 
         "I don't even want to think that there's a spy...." 

(He turns) 

Cloud 
         "I trust everyone." 

(Cloud goes up one path to a reactor in the distance. The surrounding 
area is littered with massive chunks of steel debris, and the reactor 
itself stands in ruins, as if blown apart.) 

Cloud 
         "A ruined reactor." 

(A helicopter lands near the entrance, and Scarlet and Tseng get out of it.) 

Cloud 
         "It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development."

(He hides behind the reactor. Scarlet and Tseng approach. Scarlet pokes 
around in the rubble.) 

Scarlet 
         ".....Hmph! This isn't any good either." 
         "You only get junky materia from junky reactors." 

(She walks back over to Tseng) 

Scarlet 
         "This reactor's a failure." 
         "What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?" 

Tseng 
         "No, I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away." 

Scarlet 
         "Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some." 

Tseng 
         "I just can't wait." 

Scarlet 
         "With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been getting a bigger 
budget." 

Tseng 
         "I envy them." 

Scarlet 
         "But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid 
Heidegger ever use it?" 

Tseng 
         "....." 

Scarlet 
         "Oh... sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!" 

Tseng 
         "....." 

Scarlet 
         "Let's go!" 

(They leave.) 

Cloud 
         "...Big, large, huge materia?" 
         "An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?" 
         "Just what are the Shinra up to...?" 

(The camera pans down to show Scarlet and Tseng getting into the 
helicopter, which takes off. Cloud grabs the materia Scarlet passed up, 
Titan, and heads back to the intersection and down the other path. It 
leads to Gongaga town. As Cloud enters, the camera pans up to show the 
ruined reactor we already visited.) 

Cloud 
         "A ruined reactor...." 

People in Gongaga 
  
         "............." 

         "Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband...."

(Cloud enters a house near the southern edge of Gongaga. A man gets up 
from a chair inside.) 

         "You a traveller? Hey wait, that glare in your eye... you in 
SOLDIER?" 

(A woman, presumably his wife, comes around the table) 

         "Oh you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?" 

         "His name is Zack." 

         "It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying 
that he didn't want to live in the country..." 

         "He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a 
Zack in SOLDIER?" 

Cloud 
         "Hmmm... I don't know." 

(Aerith looks down) 

Aerith 
         "Zack..." 

         "Young lady, you know him?" 

         "I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a 
girlfriend. Could that have been you?" 

(Cloud turns to Aerith) 

Aerith

Cloud

Aerith

Cloud 
         "Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've 
never heard of him." 

(She turns back to the rock) 

Aerith 
         "That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried 
because I heard he's been missing." 

Cloud 
         "Missing?" 

Aerith 
         "I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never 
came back." 
         "He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone

- Cosmo Canyon - Grudge -

(They board the buggy and head northeast, to Cosmo Canyon. Right outside 
the town, the buggy begins to spark.)

         "!?" 

(The buggy makes some loud banging noises. Cloud gets out) 

Cloud 
         "Oh man... a breakdown? Now?" 

(They enter the town of Cosmo Canyon. At the entrance, Red XIII comes 
bounding up and speaks with the gateman.) 

Red XIII 
         "I am home! It is I, Nanaki!" 

         "Hey, Nanaki! You're safe!" 
         "Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!"

(He runs off,  up some stairs) 

Cloud 
         "...Nanaki?" 

Aerith 
         "Cosmo... Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet 
or the Ancients..." 

Tifa 
         "Red XIII seems different, doesn't he?"

(Red XIII comes down the stairs) 

Red XIII 
         "They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in." 

(He runs off) 

         "...Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in." 

Cloud 
         "Who is Nanaki?" 

         "Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name." 

People in Cosmo Canyon 

         "Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home." 

         "So this is Cosmo Canyon... Quite a mysteious place."
          "Have you come to seek the 'Study of Planet Life'?" 

<CHOICE> 
         That's it

         "Whoa!" 
         "Don't scare me like that. I almost fell over." 

         "Yaay! Nanaki! Nanaki's back! It's all thanks to this flame!" 
         "This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle.' It has burned for 
generations." 
         "It's a holy flame that protects this canyon." 
         "I heard once, it only went out once, long ago." 
         "The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really 
don't know much about it." 

Elder Bugah 
         "Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?" 
         "Yeah, thanks." 

         "Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?'" 
         "A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit.

         "Oh, welcome." 
         "The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything 
here are replicas." 
         "But that's all right. Some of them you really can use." 

Elder Hargo 
         "Where did I put it...? I know it's around here..."

(Red XIII is waiting at the top of the stairs.) 

Red XIII 
         "Here is where I was.... I mean, ...this is my hometown." 
         "My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful 
canyon and the Planet." 
         "My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father 
left her....... I am the last of my race." 

Cloud 
         "Cowardly father?" 

Red XIII 
         "Yes. My father was a wastrel." 
         "And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect 
this place. My journey ends here." 

         "Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!" 

Red XIII 
         "Coming, Grandpa!"

here in a while, OK?" 

(The others run off.) 
  
  






  Scene 66 
- Bugenhagen's Observatory - 

(Cloud travels to the very top of Cosmo Canyon. He enters the shack there. 
Red XIII and Bugenhagen are waiting.) 

Red XIII 
         "Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen." 
         "He is incredible. He knows everything." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit." 
         "Nanaki is still a child you see." 

Red XIII 
         "Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity." 
         "So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of 
a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning." 

Cloud 
         "15 or 16!?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?" 

(Red XIII looks down) 

Red XIII 
         ".......grandfather. I want to be an adult." 
         "I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet." 

(He shakes his head) 

Bugenhagen 
         "To do that now would destroy you in the long run." 

(He looks up) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very 
stars from the great city of Midgar. You're seen it, haven't you?" 

(He looks forward again) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose 
perspective."

(He jumps up on the table) 

Bugenhagen 
         "When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that 
you know absolutely nothing." 

Cloud 
         ".....When the planet dies?" 

(The music fades) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But 
it's not long off." 

Cloud 
         "How do you know this?" 

(Bugenhagen looks down for a moment) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I hear the cries of the Planet." 

(There is a loud sound, resembling a whale song, very guttural, and 
natural. The camera pans up to the top of the house, showing the 
observatory there.) 

Cloud 
         "What's that?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Tha sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, 
planets are born, and die." 

(There is a much louder sound, mixing with the others, much like the 
others, but.. mournful, painful.) 

Cloud 
         "What was that?" 

(The camera pans back down to Bugenhagen, Cloud, and Red XIII.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet." 
         "Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer....." 

(The louder sound stops.) 

Red XIII 
         "They have come here on a journey to save the planet." 
         "Why don't you show them your apparatus?" 

(Bugenhagen jumps off the table. The music fades back in.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!" 

(He turns to Cloud) 

Bugenhagen 
         "But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him." 

         "Bugenhagen!" 

(The camera pans over to show a young boy enter the shack.) 

         "Several odd looking people have come." 

Bugenhagen 
         "The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden." 

Red XIII 
         "He brought friends too. I'll go get them." 

(Red XIII leaves the shack) 

Red XIII 
         "Cloud, please call one of them." 
         "Only three people can fit in grandfather's machine." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your 
friends." 

(Cloud goes and retrieves two companions, scattered around Cosmo Canyon.) 
  
  






  Scene 67 
- The Lifestream - 

(Cloud returns to the shack at the top of Cosmo Canyon.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in." 

(Cloud enters the observatory room.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then 
let's begin." 
         "I'll stand there." 

(FMV sequence as Bugenhagen activates the elevator. It takes them to the 
upper level, where there is a model of the solar system.)

Aerith 
         "So pretty... It's just like the real thing!" 

(Bugenhagen floats up near Jupiter) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory." 
         "All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic
System." 

(Aerith looks around) 

Aerith 
         "Hey! A shooting star!" 

(FMV sequence. A shooting star rockets past Aerith, followed by a glowing 
orb, and several meteors. All of these are sucked into a black hole in the 
corner.)

Aerith 
         "Wow, how wonderful." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it?" 
         "Well, let's get to the subject." 
         "Eventually... all humans die. What happens to them after they 
die?" 
         "The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much 
everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their 
souls?" 
         "The soul too returns to the Planet." 
         "And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In 
fact, all living things in the universe, are the same." 

(He raises his arms) 

Bugenhagen 
         "The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another 
and roam the Planet." 
         "They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 
'Lifestream'." 
         "Lifestream.... In other words, a path of energy of the souls 
roaming the Planet." 

(He lowers his arms) 

Bugenhagen 
         "'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget." 
         "A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are 
brought into the world." 
         "Then, the time comes with they die and once again return to the 
Planet..." 
         "Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the 
world."
         "I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this." 

(FMV sequence. The camera zooms in on model Earth. We see trees and humans 
being born, then die. Their bodies becomes masses of swirling light, then 
streak across the surface of the Earth, merging. On the other side of the 
planet, the energy forms into a new being. Streaks of energy cover the 
planet, glowing many colors. Bugenhagen floats over to the planet.) 

         Spirit energy makes all things possible, trees, birds, and humans. 

(Bugenhagen lifts his arm.) 

         Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for 
Planets to be Planets. 

(The energy begins to converge at a point near Bugenhagen's hand.) 

         What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear? 

(The energy is all drawn into Bugenhagen's sleeve. When it is all gone, the 
planet turns jet-black, and crumbles, huge chunks floating off into space. 
The camera returns to the party.)

Bugenhagen 
         "......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life." 

Cloud 
         "If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed..." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within 
nature." 
         "When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it 
can't accomplish its true purpose." 

(Cloud looks up at Bugenhagen) 

Cloud 
         "You're talking about Mako energy, right?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it." 
         "Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into 
Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away." 
         "In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet..." 

(The elevator lowers again. Bugenhagen and the others are lowered to floor 
level.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "The story of the planets... and those who lived with them...." 
         "You want to know more? Then you must listen to the words of the 
elders." 








  Scene 68 
- Cosmo Candle - 

(Cloud leaves the shack and goes down to the Cosmo Candle. The others are 
all waiting there. He sits down and talks to each one.) 

Aerith 
         "I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things." 
         "About the Cetra... And the Promised Land..." 

(She looks down) 

Aerith 
         "I'm...... alone..... I'm all alone now..." 

Cloud 
         "But I'm..... we're here for you, right?" 

(She shakes her head) 

Aerith 
         "I know. I know, but... I am the only.... Cetra." 

Cloud 
         "Does that mean we can't help?" 

(She looks away. Cloud gets up.) 

Cait Sith 
         "I wonder how many years it's been... Gosh, it brings back 
memories......" 

Barret 
         "Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born..." 
         "I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the 
Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate..." 
         "Biggs... Wedge... Jessie..." 
         "Now they're all gone... died for the planet." 
         "...Really? To save the planet?" 
         "We all... we all hate the Shinra..." 
         "Do I even got to go on?" 
         "Will they...... ...will they ever forgive me?" 

(He shakes his head) 

Barret 
         "...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing." 
         "If there's anything I can do, to save the planet... or the 
people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it!" 
         "I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I 
don't care..... let 'em decide for 'emselves." 

(He stands up and waves his arms around) 

Barret 
         "Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!!" 
         "Again.... Again.... AVALANCHE's born again!" 

(He sits back down.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud..." 
         "Bonfires are funny, aren't they?" 
         "They make you remember all sorts of things." 

(She looks at Cloud) 

Tifa 
         "You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago..." 

(Cloud nods) 

Tifa 
         ".........It's nothing." 

(She looks at the fire again) 

Tifa 
         "No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask..." 

(Cloud looks at Tifa) 

Cloud 
         "What is it...?" 

Tifa 
         "It feels like... It feels like you're going far away..." 

She looks at him) 

Tifa 
         "You really, really are..... you... right?" 

(Cloud gets up.) 

Red XIII 
         "......Long ago." 
         "...When I was still very small. We were all around this flame..." 

(He shakes his head) 

Red XIII 
         "No, never mind..." 

Cloud 
         "What happened?" 

Red XIII 
         "It's about my parents." 
         "When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy..." 
         "And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is 
full of anger..." 

(Bugenhagen floats over near them.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "...You really can't forgive your father...?" 

Red XIII 
         "Of course. He... left mother for dead." 
         "When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving 
mother and the people of the Canyon!" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see." 

Red XIII 
         "...?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "The place may be dangerous." 

(He floats off) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?" 

(Cloud chooses who he will take with him.) 
  
  






  Scene 69 
- Nanaki, Son Of Seto - 

(Cloud follows Bugenhagen to the sealed door.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo" 
         "Are we all set?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Just a minute 
         Yeah 

***Cloud 
         Just a minute 

Bugenhagen 
         "Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready." 

***Cloud 
         Yeah 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?" 
<//> 

(Bugenhagen flips a switch and the door opens.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "All right. Come in, come in." 

Red XIII 
         "Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?" 

(Bugenhagen shakes his head) 

Bugenhagen 
         "What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that!" 
         "You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right 
behind you." 

(They enter the door. Climbing down a long series of ropes and ladders, 
they reach the bottom of a long tunnel. Traversing a cave, they reach a 
doorway, where Bugenhagen speaks.)

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo." 
         "Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain 
battle." 

Red XIII 
         "A certain battle?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't 
return to the Lifestream..." 
         "We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo."

(They travel through the next cave.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon." 
         "It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they 
attacked though here, we wouldn't have stood a chance." 

Red XIII 
         ".........." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Let's move on." 

(They pass the next cave.)

Bugenhagen 
         "This warrior went through the cave all alone." 
         "Fighting attackers one after another..." 

Red XIII 
         "Grandpa........ That warrior...." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there." 

(In the next cave, they find a huge, grotesque statue on the wall, 
surrounded by lava.)



Bugenhagen 
         "What is this.....?" 

Red XIII 
         "Grandpa, is he...!?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air....." 
         "This... can't be!!" 

(Boss battle with Gi Nattak) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived." 
         "Nanaki, you have grown strong too." 

Red XIII 
         ".......Oh yeah?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here..." 
         "Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here." 

(They all file into the next room. There is a huge pile of boulders 
surrounded by fog in the center. Red XIII leaps onto it.)

Red XIII 
         "This is..." 

Bugenhagen 
         "...The warrior who fought against the Gi." 
         "He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon." 

(Bugenhagen floats, slowly, into the room.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "But he was never able to return to town..."

(He hops up on a stone and gestures upwards.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto." 

(The camera pans upwards. We see a stone figure of one of Red XIII's tribe 
atop a high cliff. The moon glows red in the sky. FMV sequence as the 
camera swings around the figure.) 

Red XIII 
         "...That... That's.... Seto?"

Bugenhagen 
         "Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. ...To the protect 
this Canyon." 
         "Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to 
stone......" 
         "Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us." 
         "And he continues to protect us, even now." 

Red XIII 
         "Even now..." 

(The camera pans back down to Red XIII and the others.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone, 
risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon." 
         "That is your father, Seto." 

(Red XIII turns to Bugenhagen.) 

Red XIII 
         "That..... that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo... She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep 
this cave shut." 
         "They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul." 
         "Thay said we should forget about this cave." 

(Red XIII looks down) 

Red XIII 
         "........." 

(Bugenhagen turns to Cloud) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Cloud..... Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?" 

(Cloud nods. He and the other exit.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Nanaki, I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the 
others." 

Red XIII 
         "Grandpa!?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Listen, Nanaki." 

(Bugenhagen floats back and forth.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Cloud says they are trying to save the planet." 
         "Honestly, I don't think it can be done." 
         "For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only 
going to postpone the inevitable." 
         "Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish." 

(Bugenhagen stops and looks at Red XIII.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately." 
         "I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do." 
         "As a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in 
misery..." 
         "No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?" 
         "Am I just wishing against fate?" 

(He shakes his head) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I am too old to do anything about it..." 
         "This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo." 

(He raises his arms) 

Bugenhagen 
         "That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake." 

(He stops and hovers.) 

Red XIII 
         "Grandpa..." 

(Bugenhagen floats away from Red XIII.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I wanted to show you your real father before you left..." 
         "I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show 
you." 

(Red XIII shakes his head.) 

Red XIII 
         "Grandpa... don't talk like that. I don't want to think of 
life... without you....." 

(Bugenhagen starts bouncing, then stops) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life." 

(Red XIII stands up courageously.) 

Red XIII 
         "Grandpa! You must live!" 
         "I'll see to it." 
         "I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back 
to tell you." 

(Bugenhagen turns towards him) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Nanaki..." 

(Red XIII leaps forward.) 

Red XIII 
         "I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto!" 
         "I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, 
Grandpa..." 

(Red XIII looks up. The camera pans up; small drops of water are falling 
from above.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "That's... Seto's..... Seto....."

Red XIII 
         "Seto... Fa... Father...." 

(Red XIII leaps to the highest point on the rock structure and howls up to 
the moon, and Seto. The camera pans up to show Seto, tears falling from 
stone eyes.)

                                                             
                                                             

  
  

  
  Scene 70 
- Red Truth - 

(Cloud and the others, save Red XIII, are sitting around the Cosmo Candle.) 

Barret 
         "They said they finished fixin' the buggy." 

(Cloud stands) 

Cloud 
         "Shall we get giong?" 

Aerith 
         "So this is it, Red XIII..." 

(Barret stands) 

Barret 
         "That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times..." 

(Cloud chooses his party and everyone leaves. On the way out of Cosmo 
Canyon, Red XIII comes running.) 

Red XIII 
         "Wait for me! I'm coming too!" 

Cloud 
         "Mmm?" 

(Bugenhagen makes his way down the stairs.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Cloud. Please look after Nanaki." 

Cloud 
         "What happened?" 

Red XIII 
         "I think I grew up a little. That's
what happened!" 

(Red XIII runs off. Cloud and the others leave Cosmo Canyon, board the 
buggy, and head west, towards Nibelheim.) 








  Scene 71 
- Nibelheim Revisited - The Black Cloak -

(Cloud and the others board the buggy and head north, to Nibelheim. They 
arrive in the central courtyard.) 

Tifa 
         "What---!!" 

(She makes a pleading gesture at Cloud) 

Tifa 
         "This was all supposed to be burnt down, right?" 

(Cloud nods) 

Cloud 
         "I thought so." 

Tifa 
         "Then why...? My house is still there too..." 

Aerith 
         "...something's strange?" 

Cloud 
         "I'm not lying!" 

(He shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "I remember... the intense heat of the flames..." 

People in Nibelheim 

         "Hi, welcome." 

<CHOICE> 
         Give me a room 
         What's your story? 

***Cloud

         "It'll be 100 gil a night. Is that all
right with you?" 

***Cloud 
         What's your story? 

Cloud 
         "This town was supposed to have burnt down five years ago." 
         "What the hell is going on?" 

         "Sir, don't say such awful things." 
         "I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened." 

Tifa 
         "You're lying..." 

         "EXCUSE ME..... That's so rude..." 
         "If you're going to talk like that to me, I'm going to have to 
ask you to leave." 
<//> 

         "Nice town, huh?" 
         "We've been in business here for a long time...." 

Cloud 
         "...You're lying." 

         "Do you have anything to do with this town?" 

<CHOICE> 
         How about bein' born and raised here? 
         Nope, guess not 

***Cloud 
         How about bein' born and raised here? 

Cloud 
         "I was here until I was 14 and I don't remember you." 

         "It's not nice to lie!!" 

***Cloud 
         Nope, guess not 

Cloud 
         "...nothing." 

         "Oh yeah...?"

Cloud 
         "I lived in this house until I was 14..."

  Scene 72 
- Calamity From the Skies -

(Cloud enters the Shinra Mansion. Taking the hidden passage in the 
fireplace, they head down to the library in the basement. Cloud stops in 
the hallway. Sephiroth stands at the other end.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth!" 

Sephiroth 
         "Being here brings back memories." 
         "Are you going to participate in the Reunion?" 

Cloud 
         "I don't even know what a Reunion is!" 

Sephiroth 
         "Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will rejoin the Reunion 
becoming a calamity from the skies." 

Cloud 
         "Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an 
Ancient!?"

Sephiroth 
         "...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate." 
         "I will go north past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then 
follow..." 

Cloud 
         "...Reunion? Calamity from the skies?" 

(Sephiroth throws a green materia at Cloud, then rises into the air and 
shoots past Cloud, out of the library. Cloud picks up the materia- a 
Destruct materia. He leaves the library and Shinra mansion.) 








  Scene 73 
- Rocket Town - Hey, Cid! - 

(Cloud heads north, to Mt. Nibel. Traversing narrow pathways and a twisted 
cave through it, they emerge on the other side of the mountain range. They 
arrive at Rocket Town.) 

Cloud 
         "What's that...!?" 

(The camera pans up to show a rocket, tilted quite badly in its launch 
platform.) 

Cloud 
         "A rusty old rocket... Wonder what they'd make something that 
huge for?"

People in Rocket Town 

         "Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge 
of it." 

<CHOICE> 
         Captain? 
         Did you see a man in a Black Cape? 

***Cloud 
         Captain? 

Cloud 
         "Who's the 'Captain'?" 

         "The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in 
their Space Program." 
         "He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an 
accident..." 
         "Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming 
about going into outer space." 

***Cloud 
         Did you see a man in a Black Cape? 

Cloud 
         "Did you see a man in a Black Cape?" 

         "A man in a Black Cape? Nope... don't know a thing about it." 
<//> 

         "Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were 
planning to launch the rocket." 

         "That rusted old rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space 
Program." 

         "This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets." 
         "You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never 
got off the ground though." 

         "A gun is a MAN's weapon! Ain't nuthin' else'll do!" (Sells 
weapons)

         "Welcome to the Shanghai Inn!" 
         "It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?" 

         "Would you like something to drink?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Let me hear your story 
         Not interested 

***Cloud 
         Let me hear your story 

         "Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's 
representative, so you should really talk with him." 

***Cloud 
         Not interested 

         "......that's too bad. Please come again." 
<//> 

         "A drink will ease your heart..." 

         "...I'm in here." 

         "Welcome! This is the Item Shop." (Sells items) 

         "All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long." 

         "My job's to make everyone laugh all over the world..."

(Cloud goes through a house and enters the back yard. There is a large 
pink plane there) 

Cloud 
         "There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco..... This is cool." 

Aerith 
         "Let's take it! OK, Cloud!" 

(A woman comes out of the house) 

         "Um... may I help you?" 

(Cloud shrugs)

Cloud 
         "No... We're just looking at it." 

         "...If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The 
Captain should be in the Rocket." 
         "I'm Shera. And what are your names?" 

Cloud 
         "I'm Cloud." 

Aerith 
         "I'm Aerith." 

Tifa 
         "Tifa. Nice to meet you." 

Shera 
         "Hmm.... So you're not with the Shinra." 
         "I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program 
came." 

Cloud 
         "......!?" 

Shera 
         "President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so 
restless all morning." 

(She leaves) 

Cloud 
         "Rufus!!?"

(Cloud leaves the house and heads north, to the rocket. Climbing ladders 
and traversing platforms, he reaches the interior of the rocket, where a 
gray-haired man in a flight jacket is working on some mechanics.)

         "What're you guys doin' here?" 

Cloud 
         "We heard the Captain was here." 

(He laughs) 

         "Captain? I'm the Captain!" 

(The PLAYER names Cid) 

Cid 
         "The name's Cid. Everyone calls me, 'Captain,' though." 
         "What d'ya want?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Tell me about this rocket 
         Is Rufus coming? 
         Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco?" 

***Cloud 
         Tell me about this rocket 

(Cid laughs) 

Cid 
         "Wow! Not bad for a kid." 
         "Alright then, I'll explain it to you." 

(He, uh, scratches...) 

Cid 
         "You know Shinra developed a lot of techological gadgets during 
the meaningless war, right?" 
         "Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons 
manufacturer." 

(Cloud nods) 

Cid 
         "Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine." 
         "There was so much excitement about the thought of going into 
outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger." 
         "They put a major budget into it and made prototype after 
prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26." 
         "They chose the best pilot in Shinra-- no, in the world-- me. I 
mean, come on." 

(He faces the wall and sighs) 

Cid 
         "And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was 
goin' well..." 

(He kicks the wall) 

Cid 
         "But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. 
That's why they became so anal!" 

(He turns back to Cloud) 

Cid 
         "And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans." 
         "After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got 
my damn hopes up... DAMN THEM!" 

(He turns back to the wall) 

Cid 
         "Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was 
profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration." 
         "Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for 
them!" 
         "Look at this busted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man 
in space with this." 

(He shakes his head) 

Cid 
         "Everyday, it tilts a little bit more." 
         "At this rate, I don't know which will come first, this thing 
falling down or me gettin' outta here." 

(He turns back to the wall, and slumps) 

Cid 
         "My last hope is to talk to the President......" 

***Cloud 
         Is Rufus coming? 

Cid 
         "Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program." 
         "A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, 
too!" 

***Cloud 
         Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"? 

(He shakes his head) 

Cid 
         "You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished 
possession. I can't let you take it."

  Scene 74 
- Sending a Dream Into the Universe - Tiny Bronco Escapes! -

(Cloud returns to Cid and Shera's home.) 

Shera 
         "Excuse me.... Cloud?" 

(She comes in from the back yard) 

Shera 
         "Did the Captain say anything?" 

Cloud 
         "Nope..." 

Shera 
         "Oh...?" 

(Cid enters the front door) 

Cid 
         "^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?" 
         "We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!" 

Shera 
         "I... I'm sorry." 

(She hurries to the stove) 

Cloud 
         "Really, don't mind us." 

(Cid waves his arms around) 

Cid 
         "Shut up! Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn 
TEA!" 
         "Arggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!" 
         "Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco!" 
         "An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?" 

(He leaves out back) 

Aerith 
         "Sheesh...!! What bad manners!" 

Cloud 
         "Sorry. It's our fault." 

(Shera turns from the stove) 

Shera 
         "No, no. He's always like this." 

Tifa 
         "Is it always like this...? Why is Cid so hard on you?" 

(Shera shakes her head) 

Shera 
         "No... It's because of my stupid mistake." 
         "I was the one who destroyed his dream..." 

Cloud 
         "What happened?"

(The scene fades to a view of a room in the rocket, lined with oxygen 
tanks; it is sepia-toned. Cid watches Shera work on one of the tanks.) 

Cid 
         "Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!" 
         "Even the moon'd get tired watin' around for your ass!" 

(Shera gets up) 

Shera 
         "I'm... I'm sorry." 

Cid 
         "Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!" 
         "Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good no matter 
how many times you check that oxygen tank." 
         "That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over." 

Shera 
         "But..." 

(Cid waves his arms around) 

Cid 
         "No buts!!" 
         "You're not stupid, so be more efficient!" 

Shera 
         "I'm sorry....."

(The scene shifts. We are now at the room at the top of the rocket, where 
Cloud and Cid had their first discourse. Several men are running around 
working on the rocket. Cid comes in, sans flight goggles) 

         "Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!" 

         "We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26." 

         "Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!" 

(Cid laughs)


Cid 
         "Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!" 

         "All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!" 

(The workers line up and Cid walks between them, into the cockpit.) 

Cid 
         "Thanks, guys!" 

         "We're praying for your safety!" 

(Cid sits down at the control panel of the rocket.) 

Cid 
         "Instrument panel... all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch." 

(Static comes over the radio) 

         "Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. 
Beginning countdown." 

Cid 
         "..........finally." 

(An alarm sounds. Red warning lights begin to flash.) 

Cid 
         "What the? What happened!?" 

         "Cid! We have an emergency situtation!" 
         "A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!" 

Cid 
         "What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?" 

         "I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section." 

(The scene switches back to the oxygen tank room. Cid comes over the 
intercom) 

Cid 
         "Hey, goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?" 

Shera 
         "It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch." 

Cid 
         "Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?" 

Shera 
         "I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test 
weren't satisfactory." 

Cid 
         "You stupid little ^$#^%!" 
         "It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT 
left when we blast off!" 
         "You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know 
that, doncha!?" 

(Shera shakes her head) 

Shera 
         "I don't mind." 
         "If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost 
done." 

(She goes back to the tank) 

Cid 
         "Almost done!? You're gonna die!" 

         "Cid, we must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!" 

(The scene switches back to the cockpit) 

         "Starting engine!" 

Cid 
         "Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!" 

         "What are you going to do, Cid? If we cancel now, it'll be 
another six months until the next launch!" 

Cid 
         "GODDAMMIT, Shera... you wanna make me a murderer?" 

(Shera comes over the intercom) 

Shera 
         "Captain!" 

Cid 
         "Shera!?" 

Shera 
         "Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, 
it's all clear." 

Cid 
         "Come on, Shera... hurry up... You're gonna die..." 

         "30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown." 

Cid 
         "Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!" 

         "Cid! Forget about her. We won't make it in time!" 

Cid 
         "What... what am I... What am I supposed to do...?" 

         "15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising." 

Cid 
         "Oh man, the moon... outer space... my dreams..." 

         "Ignite engine!" 

Cid 
         "SH------------IT!" 

(He, resignedly, drops his arm and presses a button. FMV sequence. The 
rocket engine ignites, then stops within seconds. The rocket falls back 
down to earth, loses its balance, and tips over, coming to rest off-center 
in the launch platform. The scene switches back to Cid and Shera's home.)

Shera 
         "He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the 
mission, to save my life." 
         "After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was 
canceled." 
         "It's my fault his dream was destroyed..." 

(She shakes her head) 

Shera 
         "That's why... it's all right. I don't care what the Captain 
says, I'll live my life for him." 

(Cid comes back inside.) 

Cid 
         "Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!" 

Shera 
         "I... I'm sorry." 

(Shera rushes back to the stove. Cid  crashes in a chair and hoists one 
leg up onto the table.) 

Cid 
         "Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for 
you!?" 

(He leans his head in one hand and taps his foot) 

Cid 
         "They're late... Where is Rufus...?" 

(The front door opens and a rather portly fellow waddles in) 

Palmer 
         "Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So Cid, how ya been?" 

(They all turn to face Palmer. Cid hops up) 

Cid 
         "Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on 
keepin' me waitin'!?" 

(He runs over to Palmer) 

Cid 
         "So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?" 

(Palmer dances side to side) 

Palmer 
         "Hey-hey! I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you 
ask him?" 

Cid 
         "^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!" 

(He runs out. Palmers starts swaying faster) 

Palmer 
         "Don't say 'fat'!" 

(He stops and walks over to Shera) 

Palmer 
         "Hey-hey! Tea!" 
         "Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and... oh yeah, 
don't forget the lard!" 

(Cloud goes outside. Rufus has arrived and is talking with Cid) 

Cid 
         "What the.....! You got me all excited for nothing!?" 
         "Then, what'd you come here for?" 

Rufus 
         "I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco." 
         "We're going after Sephiroth. But it seems like we're been going 
in the wrong direction." 
         "But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to 
cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane..." 

Cid 
         "&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny 
Bronco." 
         "Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take 
the sky away from me too!?" 

Rufus 
         "Oh my..." 
         "You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were 
able to fly in the first place." 

Cid 
         "What!?" 

(Shera comes out of the house) 

Shera 
         "Uh, excuse me..." 

(Cloud turns) 

Shera 
         "This way..." 

(They go back into the house. Shera shuts the door) 

Shera 
         "You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?" 

(Cloud nods) 

Shera 
         "I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?" 

(Cloud heads out back. Palmer is sitting on the Tiny Bronco) 

Palmer 
         "Hmm... Why do I have to do this...? I'm the head of the Space 
Program..." 

(Cloud goes up to him) 

Cloud 
         "We'll be takin' that Tiny Bronco." 

Palmer 
         "I've seen you somewhere before..." 

(He scratches his head) 

Palmer 
         "I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp!" 
         "Se... se... security!!" 

(Boss battle with Palmer)

(After the battle, the Tiny Bronco fires up. Palmer narrowly escapes being 
scalped by the propeller, then runs away... he amost makes it, except he 
manages to get hit by a truck. Cloud and the others all jump onto the Tiny 
Bronco.) 

Tifa 
         "It won't stop!" 

Cloud 
         "Forget it! Get in!!" 

(FMV sequence. The Tiny Bronco takes off, loops around the rocket, and 
buzzes Rufus and his guards, who begin firing at the Bronco. Cid dashes to 
catch up with it and leaps onto the tail. The guards' fire hits the tail, 
which begins sparking.)

Cid 
         "Shit!! The tail's been hit!" 

Cloud 
         "Emergency landing..." 

Cid 
         "This's gonna be a big splash. Hold onto your drawers and don't 
piss in 'em!"

(FMV sequence as the Bronco makes a crash landing in the middle of the 
ocean.)








  Scene 75 
- Tiny Bronco Afloat - 

(Cloud, Cid, and the others are aboard the Tiny Bronco, adrift in the 
ocean. Cid is lying with his head almost in the water, arms dangling.)

Cid 
         "She won't fly anymore." 

Cloud 
         "Can't we use it as a boat?" 

Cid 
         "$#&%! Do whatever you want!" 

Cloud 
         "Cid, what are you going to do now?" 

Cid 
         "Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the 
town." 

Cloud 
         "How 'bout your wife? How 'bout Shera?" 

Cid 
         "Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her 
gives me the chills." 
         "What're you guys gonna do?" 

Cloud 
         "We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get 
Rufus of the Shinra someday too." 

Cid 
         "I don't know about any of that, but..." 

(He stands up) 

Cid 
         "What the hell!? Sign me up!" 

Cloud 
         "How 'bout it, everyone?" 

(Tifa stands) 

Tifa 
         "Of course, no problem!" 

Cid 
         "Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!" 

Cloud 
         "Numskulls...?" 

Cid 
         "Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has 
GOTTA be a numskull! I like it!" 

(He shrugs) 

Cid 
         "So, where we headed?" 
         "Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the 
Ancients." 

Cloud 
         "Really!? ...Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?" 

Cid 
         "Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'the 
wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?" 

Cloud 
         "Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the 
Ancients... that name bothers me." 

(They sail the Tiny Bronco out over the ocean.) 








Scene 76 
- The Keystone -

(Cloud and the others have gained the Tiny Bronco to wander about the 
world. At this point, the party can pretty much do what they please. 
Onward they journey. Cloud and the others travel to a small shack outside 
the Gold Saucer. A salesman inside walks over.) 

         "Huh? Oh, another customer. You sure picked an out of the way 
place but..." 
         "But if it's the "Keystone" you're looking for, you're too late. 
Don't have it." 

Cloud 
         "Keystone?" 

         "What? You didn't come here for that?" 
         "The "Keystone is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old 
temple somewhere." 
         "You're not going to believe your ears," 
         "But I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!" 

Cloud 
         "The Temple of the Ancients..." 

         "Kya, hah hah hah..." 
         "Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!" 

(He goes about his business) 

         "Huh? What?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Where is this "Keystone"? 
         Where is the Temple? 
         Let's change the subject 
         Never mind 

***Cloud 
         Where is this "Keystone"? 

         "I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really 
want to sell it but..." 
         "That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not 
be a good idea NOT to sell it to him..." 

Cloud 
         "Who did you sell it to?" 

         "The manager of the Gold Saucer... think his name was "Dio". 
Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here." 

***Cloud 
         Where is the Temple? 

         "Come on... it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure 
would be something, huh?" 
         "Now that you mention it, I have heard of something called 
Ultimate Destruction Magic" 
         "was supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the 
Ancients." 

Cloud 
         "Ultimate Destruction Magic...?" 

         "Come on! I told you not to take it seriously!" 

***Cloud 
         Let's change the subject 

         "All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't 
been able to get materials..." 

***Cloud 
         Never mind 
<//>

(Cloud travels to the Gold Saucer and goes to Dio's Show Room at the 
Battle Square. The Keystone is sitting on a pedestal in the center.) 

Cloud 
         "It's the Keystone..." 

(Dio enters, laughing) 

Dio 
         "Heh, heh, heh. Long time no see, my boy. Hmm? You like that, 
huh?" 

Cloud 
         "Can you let me borrow this?" 

(Dio laughs) 

Dio 
         "Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent." 
         "Hmm." 
         "Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it 
on one condition." 

Cloud 
         "One condition?" 

(Dio laughs) 

Dio 
         "Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!" 

<CHOICE> 
         What'd you want me to do? 
         Not in the mood 

***Cloud 
         What'd you want me to do? 

Dio 
         "Hoo boy!" 
         "Heh, heh, heh. It's not something that's really difficult." 
         "This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just 
you, my boy, I'm expecting a good fight!" 

(Cloud battles in the Battle Square.) 

***Cloud 
         Not in the mood 

Dio 
         "I see... Then let's pretend that this never happened." 
<//> 

(After the battle, and depending on your performance...) 

Dio 
         "That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go 
ahead, take it." 

(You get the Keystone) 

Dio 
         "Well then, we shall meet again! Heh, heh, heh." 








  Scene 77 
- Ghost Hotel Conversation - 

(Cloud heads for the Station Square. A workman is standing outside the 
Ropeway) 

Staff 
         "Excuse me, sir." 
         "I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now." 

Cloud 
         "...so?" 

Staff 
         "I'm really sorry!" 
         "I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully 
repaired." 

(Cait Sith comes bounding up) 

Cait Sith 
         "What's wrong?" 

(Cloud explains) 

Cait Sith 
         "Too bad. It happens, though." 
         "I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go 
talk to them." 

(He bounds off) 

Staff 
         "I will let you know once the repairs are completed."

(The scene shifts to later that night. The entire party is gathered in the 
lobby of the Ghost Hotel. Cid is dozing in a big comfy chair.) 

Cait Sith 
         "We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?" 
         "Cloud, how 'bout it? Can you tell us what's happened so far?" 
         "I don't really know what's gon' on because I wasn't here in the 
beginning." 

(Cid looks up) 

Cid 
         "Yeah! I'm all for it!" 

Barret 
         "I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the 
hell's goin' on either." 
         "Cloud, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'm tired... 
         All right, I'll give it a shot... 

***Cloud 
         I'm tired... 

Cid 
         "All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you 
complaining about?" 

***Cloud 
         All right, I'll give it a shot... 

Cloud 
         "Phew..." 
<//> 

Cloud 
         "We are going after Sephiroth." 
         "Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land." 

Cid 
         "The Promised Land?" 

Cloud 
         "A land full of Mako energy, ... or at least that's what the 
Shinra believe." 
         "I don't know if it actually exists." 

Aerith 
         "The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises 
boundless happiness." 

Barret 
         "Cetra? That some kinda disease?" 

Aerith 
         "That's what the Ancients call themselves." 
         "Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?" 
         "...You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is." 
         "You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, 
'...this is the Promised Land.'" 

(Cloud turns to Aerith) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith... can you feel it too?" 

Aerith 
         "I think so." 

Tifa 
         "So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for 
the Promised Land? Is that it?" 

Aerith 
         "That, and one other thing he's searching for." 

Cloud 
         "The Black Materia..." 

Cait Sith 
         "I heard from Dio that a man in a Black Cape was lookin' for the 
Black Materia." 

Tifa 
         "I don't even know what the Black Cape is..." 
         "How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there?" 

Red XIII 
         "...you know, of course... My tattoo is number 13." 

Cloud 
         "How did you get that tattoo?" 

Red XIII 
         "...Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the 
number was done by Hojo." 

Tifa 
         "So there are at least 13!?" 

Aerith 
         "...You know......" 
         "I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes." 
         "But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though..." 
         "That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, me too! It's all just to damn confusin'." 

Aerith 
         "And..." 

(She puts her hands to her face) 

Aerith 
         "I'm sorry, forget it!" 
         "I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now." 

(She runs upstairs) 

Cait Sith 
         "What was that, all of a sudden!?" 
         "Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?" 

(Cloud shrugs) 

Cloud 
         "You wouldn't understand even if I told you." 

Barret 
         "Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!" 

(Barret runs upstairs) 

Red XIII 
         "Cloud..." 

(He turns to face Cloud) 

Red XIII 
         "I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?" 

(Tifa kneels by him) 

Tifa 
         "I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so 
far, right?" 

Red XIII 
         "But..." 

Tifa 
         "Be strong." 

(He looks at the floor) 

Red XIII 
         "But, I..." 

Tifa 
         "Stop it, Red XIII! Be strong!" 

Cloud 
         "Tifa?" 

Tifa 
         "You're not the only one who's worried!" 

Cait Sith 
         "I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation..." 

Cid 
         "...zzzz...zzzz..." 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  






  Scene 78 
- A Midnight Date - Interrupted by Fireworks - 

(The scene fades in to Cloud's room at the Ghost Hotel. He is standing 
by the window, watching the rain storm outside. There comes a knock at 
the door. Cloud goes to answer it, but before he gets there, Aerith bursts 
in.) 

Aerith 
         "Hee, hee!" 

Cloud 
         "What's wrong?" 

(She leans toward Cloud) 

Aerith 
         "You want to go on a date?" 

Cloud 
         "What?" 

Aerith 
         "A DA-TE! Or haven't you ever gone on one?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't take me for a fool 
         Well, not a real one... 

***Cloud 
         Don't take me for a fool 

(He crosses his arms) 

Aerith 
         "Hey... a littke touchy, aren't we?" 

***Cloud 
         Well, not a real one... 

Aerith 
         "No, just a mixed-up kid..." 

(She runs around behind him and starts pushing him out the door) 

Aerith 
         "Oh well. Come on, let's go." 

Cloud 
         "Hey." 

(They end up at the Station Square. An attendant greets them) 

         "Tonight's Enchantment Night! All the attractions are free." 
         "How 'bout it you two? There's going to be an entertaining show 
in Event Square!" 

Aerith 
         "Come on, let's go."

(They go to the Event Square. For the first time, the seats are filled.) 

         "Congratulations!!" 
         "You are our 100th couple today!"

         "You two will be the leads in tonight's show!!!!" 

Cloud 
         "Wha?" 

         "Oh, now, it's not hard. Just play it however you want to and 
the rest of the cast will cover up for you." 
         "Come this way." 

Cloud 
         "H, hey!" 

Aerith 
         "This sounds like fun. Come on Cloud, let's do it." 

(The scene switches to the stage at the front of Event Square. The 
backdrop is decked out with paintings of a house, a Debu Chocobo, and 
"GOLD SAUCER" scrawled in clumsy white letters.) 

Narration 
         "Long, long ago..." 
         "An evil shadow appeared over the peaceful kingdom of Galdia..." 
         "Princess Rosa was just kidnapped by the Evil Dragon King, 
Valvados. What will become of her?" 
         "Just then, the legendary hero, Alfred, appears!!" 

(Cloud is pushed out on stage. A knight dances over next to him)

Knight 
         "Oh... You must be the legendary hero... Alfred!" 

(Cloud sort of looks around) 

Knight 
         "Hey, it's your line."

Knight 
         "Yeah, you." 
         "Ahem!"

Knight 
         "Oh... You must be the legendary hero... Alfred!" 
         "I know in my soul. Please... please save Princess Rosa!" 

(He kneels and raises his arms) 

Knight 
         "Now... Please talk... to the King....!!" 

(The King dances out on stage. Cloud runs over to him) 

King 
         "Oh... legendary hero, Alfred. You have come to save my beloved 
Rosa..." 
         "On the peak of a dangerous mountain... dwells the Evil Dragon 
King, Valvados... who's kidnapped Princess Rosa..." 
         "But... you can't beat the Evil Dragon King now! Talk to one who 
can help you......."

         "Here you are, two tickets." 
         "Enjoy the sights of the Gold Saucer."

(The gondola trundles off. The camera switches to the interior of the 
gondola, Aerith sitting on one side, Cloud on the other. Aerith looks 
out the window constantly.) 

Aerith 
         "Wow, how nice." 

(Cloud looks out the window. FMV sequence of the gondola passing through 
beautiful searchlights, rides, and various happy things.)

Chocobo track and the Chocobos hurtle past the window.)

fireworks, lighting up the entire Saucer.)

(She looks down) 

Aerith 
         ".........first off, it bothered me how you looked exactly 
alike."

         "I want to meet..... you." 

(One final, brightest, most stunnning yellow flower of fire lights up the 
night sky. The gondola returns to Round Square.)

Aerith 
         "Oh, look at the time. We'd better get going." 

(Cloud nods. They both head off.) 








  Scene 79 
- A Spy!? - 

(We are at Station Square. Cait Sith pops out of the Ghost Square portal 
and looks around. Cloud and Aerith return from Round Square. Cait Sith is 
facing away from them.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey? What's Cait Sith doing?" 

(Cait Sith holds up a green stone) 

Cloud 
         "!!" 
         "Is that the... Keystone?" 
         "Hey! Cait Sith!" 

(Cait Sith runs off. They chase him all around the Gold Saucer, visiting 
almost every square, until they reach the Chocobo Square. The chase him 
around the lobby and back outside, where the Shinra helicopter is waiting. 
Cait Sith tosses the stone up to the helicopter.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Here! The Keystone!" 

Tseng 
         "Well done." 

(The helicopter flies off.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey!" 

Cait Sith 
         "W, wait a second. I won't run or
hide." 
         "Yes, I was a spy. I was hired by
the Shinra." 

Aerith 
         "...I trusted you. I can't believe
you!" 

Cait Sith 
         "I couldn't help it." 
         "How 'bout if we continue like
nothing ever happened?" 

Cloud 
         "No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but 
being a spy!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Then what are you goin' to do? Kill me?" 
         "You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just 
a toy anyway." 
         "My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controllin' 
this toy cat from there." 

Aerith 
         "So you're from the Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Whoa, I can't tell you my name." 

Cloud 
         "We're not gettin' anywhere." 

Cait Sith 
         "See? I told you! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just 
continue our journey?" 

Cloud 
         "You think I'm jokin'!?" 

Cait Sith 
         "...Alright, yes, I am a Shinra employee." 
         "But we're not entirely enemies." 
         "...Something bothers me. I think it's your way of life." 
         "You don't get paid. You don't get praised. Yet, you still risk 
your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me..." 

(A pause) 

Cait Sith 
         "It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too 
good if things ended the way they are now." 

Aerith 
         ".......And so on, and so on..." 

Cloud 
         "He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy." 
         "We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon, get real!!" 

Cait Sith 
         "...just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference." 
         "But I prepared something in case this happened." 
         "Why don't you listen to this?" 

(Cait Sith holds up a small radio. A tiny voice comes in over it.) 

         "Papa! Tifa!" 

Aerith 
         "Hey! That's Marlene!" 

         "Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady..." 

(He turns it off.) 

Cait Sith 
         "...So, you have to do as I say." 

Cloud 
         "...you're the lowest..." 

Cait Sith 
         "I didn't want to do this... using dirty tricks and taking 
hostages..." 
         "But this is how it is... no compromises. So why don't we continue 
on as we did?" 

(He starts to head off, then turns.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it 
is so I'll tell you later." 
         "Of course, we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to 
deal with that." 

(He bounds off.) 

Cloud 
         "...Well, we're stuck... We'll have to do what he says." 

Aerith 
         "I wonder if Marlene is all right... I wonder what happened to 
Mom." 

(The scene fades to black.) 

(Cloud wakes up in his room at the Ghost Hotel. He comes downstairs; all 
the party is waiting.)

Cait Sith 
         "What took you so long, Cloud?" 
         "Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take 
the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it." 
         "Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?" 

(Aerith raises her hand) 

Aerith 
         "I want to go! I'm going for sure!" 

(Cloud chooses his party and heads for the door. Cait Sith turns) 


Cait Sith 
         "Then see you later." 

(Cloud leaves the Gold Saucer and heads to the Temple of the Ancients.) 
  
  






  Scene 80 
- Temple Of The Ancients - Tseng's
Meeting - 

(Cloud arrives at the Temple of the Ancients. Aerith stands on the rope 
bridge before it, then falls to the ground.)

Aerith 
         "This is... the Temple of the Ancients..." 
         "I... I know... I feel it... the knowledge of the Ancients.. 
floating..." 
         "You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it 
with the strength of will." 
         "For the future? For us?"

(Cloud runs over and kneels by her.) 

Cloud 
         "What are you saying? Do you understand?" 

(Aerith gets up and runs further into the Temple, stopping to stand on the 
stairs leading to the top.) 

Aerith 
         "You're uneasy... But happy?" 

(She looks around at nothing) 

Aerith 
         "Because I'm here? I'm sorry... I don't understand."

(She runs back to Cloud. Only a sharp-eyed player will see a black-cloaked 
figure exit the door at the top of the Temple and slump to the ground.) 

Aerith 
         "I want to go inside!" 

(The go to the top on the Temple and find the black-cloaked figure. He 
slowly stands up.) 

         "Black........ Materia....." 

(He falls down. Aerith kneels by him) 

Aerith 
         "Look......" 

(Tifa checks him.) 

Tifa 
         "Number 9. Another man with a tattoo." 

(A white glow bathes the area and a translucent body floats skyward. Cloud 
heads inside the Temple. Inside, they find Tseng slumped against an altar.)

Aerith 
         "Hey! It's Tseng!" 

(Tseng slowly gets to his feet.) 

Cloud 
         "Tseng? Of the Turks?" 

Tseng 
         "Uh... I've been had." 

(He slumps back down) 

Tseng 
         "It's not the Promised Land... Sephiroth's searching for..." 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth? He's inside!?" 

(Tseng raises a hand toward the altar.) 

Tseng 
         "Look... for yourself..." 

(He lets it fall) 

Tseng 
         "Damn..." 
         "Letting Aerith go was the start... of my... bad luck..." 
         "The President... was wrong..." 

(Aerith steps forward, hands on her hips) 

Aerith 
         "You're wrong." 
         "The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined." 

(She faces away from all of them.) 

Aerith 
         "And, I'm not going to help." 
         "Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won." 

(She goes and stands in a corner.) 

Tseng 
         "...pretty harsh. Sounds like something... you'd say." 

(Tseng gets up and hands something to Cloud.) 

Tseng 
         "The Keystone... Place it... on... the altar..." 

(You get the Keystone.) 

(Tseng goes and slumps in another corner. Cloud goes over to Aerith, then 
faces away from her back.) 

Cloud 
         "You crying?" 

(Aerith shakes her head and turns around) 

Aerith 
         "...Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since 
we were little..." 
         "There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there 
are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me."

(Cloud and the others go to the altar.) 

Cloud 
         "Let's put the Keystone in." 

(The camera switches over Cloud's shoulder as we watch him put the Keystone 
in the altar. It begins to glow a bright blue. A secret elevator opens in 
the floor and Cloud is lowered to a complex maze.) 

Aerith 
         "Words... feelings... So many of them here." 

Tifa 
         "What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?" 

(Aerith runs over to Cloud)

Aerith 
         "...Cloud! I know it's going to be tough, but..." 
         "Don't give up! We can do it!" 

(Cloud navigates the maze. There is a little rabbit-like creature, the 
Lagomorph from Final Fantasy 6, that he chases until he eventually catches 
it in a small room.) 

         "nyum... nyum..." 

Aerith 
         "Phew! We finally caught up to you." 
         "I'm sorry. You waited for me." 
         "Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients." 
         "They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect 
this Temple." 
         "Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk." 
         "Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because 
there was only one objective for those left in the Temple." 

(She goes over to it)

Aerith 
         "Please, talk to me!" 

(She shakes her head) 

Aerith 
         "No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid...?" 
         "Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?" 

(They leave the room and continue through the maze. They encounter the 
Lagomorph again, which they follow into a long hallway. Here, boulders with 
gaps in them roll past, and the player must guide Cloud into the gaps to 
avoid getting squashed. They reach the end of the room, passing a place in 
the center where another walkway joins the hallway. This walkway leads to a 
stone platform with a pool of water, glowing an eerie violet, in the 
center. Aerith stops to catch her breath.) 

Aerith 
         "Phew--- We did it!" 

Cloud 
         "Everyone all right? That sure took a lot out of us." 

(The screen flashes briefly. Aerith jumps, runs toward the center of the 
room, then turns back.) 

Aerith 
         "Oh no... Cloud. Come quick!" 

(She runs offscreen, then back again) 

Aerith 
         "Hurry, this way!"

(They follow Aerith to the pool in the center of the room. It begins to 
emit bright, pure purple light.) 

Aerith 
         "It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients." 
         "No... not knowledge... consciousness... a living soul..." 

(She looks up and raises her arms) 

Aerith 
         "It's trying to say something." 

(She kneels down by the pool.) 

Aerith 
         "I'm sorry, I don't understand." 

(She lies down and puts her head almost into the pool.) 

Aerith 
         "What?" 
         "What is it?" 

(She stands up) 

Aerith 
         "...Danger? An evil... consciousness?" 
         "...show? You're going to show me?" 

(The screen goes white, then switches to a room deep within the Temple; 
the walls are painted with intricate murals. Cloud and the others are in 
the foreground, gone transparent, so that we can see Tseng standing in the 
background.) 

Cloud 
         "...What's going on?" 

(Aerith turns to him) 

Aerith 
         "Wait! Look! It's showing us!"

(They all turn to watch. Elena comes running in) 

Elena 
         "Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?" 

(Tseng turns to Elena) 

Tseng 
         "...I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President." 

(Elena nods and runs around him.) 

Elena 
         "Be careful, Tseng." 

Tseng 
         "Yeah..." 
         "Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?" 

(She nods) 

Elena 
         "Th... Thank you very much." 
         "If I may be excused..." 

(She runs off. Tseng looks down for a moment, then turns and looks at the 
wall.) 

Tseng 
         "Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be..." 

(The screen flashes white. A transparent form of Sephiroth walks past, 
seemingly right through Cloud and the others. The screen flashes again. 
Sephiroth floats in, behind Tseng. He kneels, his sword straight up, and 
his body glows white. Tseng turns.) 

Tseng 
         "Sephiroth!!"

(Sephiroth stands.) 

Sephiroth 
         "So you opened the door. Well done." 

(Tseng walks toward Sephiroth, then stops.) 

Tseng 
         "This place... what is it?" 

Sephiroth 
         "A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the 
Ancients..." 

(He faces the camera and raises his arms.) 

Sephiroth 
         "I am becoming one with the Planet." 

Tseng 
         "One with the Planet?" 

(The screen flashes white again. A second Sephiroth forms, flashing white, 
arms raised. He faces the camera. Sephiroth lowers his arms and turns 
away.) 

Sephiroth 
         "You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it." 
         "All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom... 
knowledge..." 
         "I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... It will 
become one with me." 

Tseng 
         "...you can do that?" 

(The second Sephiroth-form lowers his arms and stares straight at the 
translucent Cloud and the others.) 

Sephiroth 
         "The way....... lies here." 

(The second Sephiroth form begins to laugh.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Only death awaits you all. But do not fear." 

(Sephiroth draws his sword and rushes Tseng. With the sound of sliding 
metal, Tseng falls to the ground. The screen goes red.) 

Sephiroth 
         "For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, 
you will live again as a part of me." 

(The form of Sephiroth goes rocketing skyward, showing the real Sephiroth 
behind, knelt over Tseng's body, sword drawn, breathing heavily. The scene 
switches back to the glowing pool.) 

Aerith 
         "Did you see it?" 

Tifa 
         "...I saw it." 

Cloud 
         "...Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?" 

Aerith 
         "Almost there..." 

(Cloud steps away.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth is here, right?" 
         "No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here." 
         "I'm taking him out!" 

Tifa 
         "We're here too, you know." 

(They all continue on. They do not notice the form of Sephiroth descend, 
into the glowing pool. Eventually he shoots out, and the pool stops 
glowing.) 








  Scene 81 
- Meteor - A Wound So Large - 

(Cloud continues through the Temple. He reaches a large, round room shaped 
like a clock. The floor is fallen away, leaving a deep, dark pit. The 
spindle in the center of it speaks.) 

         "I am the Time Guardian. Ye who seek the knowledge of the 
Ancients. I control the time, select your path." 

(Cloud can spin the clock hands to reach each of twelve doors around the 
room. After getting the treasure in rooms 4, 7, and 8, he sets course for 
room 6. Inside, we see another Lagomorph, who spots the party, freaks, and 
runs into one of many doors. There is one large, central door near the 
top. Aerith runs over to it and bangs on it.) 

Aerith 
         "Hey! It's locked." 
         "No good. We have to catch it!" 

(She runs back over.)

Aerith 
         "You must be tired." 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah 
         I want to go home 

***Cloud 
         Yeah 

Aerith 
         "Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back at these hard times 
and laugh."


***Cloud 
         I want to go home 

Aerith 
         "Yeah. But it'll all be over soon!" 
<//> 

(They start to chase the Lagomorph.) 

         "The Guard that escaped with the key to the door moves on a set 
course." 
         "Memorize the doors he enters and exits to figure out the pattern 
and catch him at an exit." 
         "Oh yeah, oh yeah... you can jump down to the ramp below and to 
the left of the screen." 

(Catching the Lagomorph, they enter the now-unlocked door. Inside, they 
find it is the same room the flashback at the pool took place in.) 

Aerith 
         "This is the room with the murals..." 

(Aerith turns to Cloud, who swings his arms determinedly.) 

Cloud 
         "Where are you!? Sephiroth!!" 

(The screen flashes white and Sephiroth appears, kneeling at first, then 
straightening and rising into the air. He seems doubled, as if two 
Sephiroths are occupying the same space.)

Sephiroth 
         "So cold." 
         "I am always by your side." 
         "Come." 

(Sephiroth rockets skyward. Cloud follows, to the right. He finds 
Sephiroth admiring one of the murals. He crosses his arms.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Splendid." 

(He turns and walks toward Cloud. He is limping slightly.) 

Sephiroth 
         "A treasure house of knowledge..." 

Cloud 
         "I don't understand what you're saying!" 

(Sephiroth starts laughing. The screen flashes white and he disappears. 
Cloud follows again, to the right. He finds Sephiroth, looking at a mural 
which depicts a huge round object hurtling earthward. He is trembling. He 
turns and comes toward Cloud.)

Sephiroth 
         "Look well." 

Cloud 
         "At what!?" 

Sephiroth 
         "At that which adds to the knowledge of..." 

(He raises his arms.) 

Sephiroth 
         "I am becoming one with the
Planet."


(He lowers them slowly and begins to laugh. The screen goes white as he 
shoots skyward once more. Cloud follows to the right again. He finds 
Sephiroth this time reclining on the floor, leaned against a small altar.)

Sephiroth 
         "Mother..... it's almost time...." 
         "Soon..... we will become one." 

(Sephiroth slowly stands. Aerith puts her hands on her hips, almost 
comically, as they all assume offensive stances.) 

Aerith 
         "How do you intend to become one with the Planet?" 

(Sephiroth turns to Aerith and slashes his sword at the air.) 

Sephiroth 
         "It's simple." 
         "Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the 
injury." 

(He slashes again, chuckling.) 

Sephiroth 
         "The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the 
injury." 

(He thrusts his sword into the ground.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the 
very life of the Planet?" 
         "Think how much energy would be gathered!" 

(He pulls his sword from the ground. His whole body begins to flash, 
electrically, as he laughs.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me." 
         "All that boundless energy will be mine." 

(He slashes his sword.) 

Sephiroth 
         "By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a 
new life forn, a new existence." 
         "Melding with the Planet... I will cease to exist as I am now." 
         "Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul." 

(Sephiroth begins to pulse with energy, faster and faster, until his whole 
body glows an evil white.) 

Aerith 
         "An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?" 
         "Injure... the Planet?" 

Sephiroth 
         "Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic... Meteor." 

Cloud 
         "That'll never happen!" 

(The screen flashes white as Sephiroth rushes past Cloud, flying through 
the air.) 

         "Wake up!!" 

(The white fades. Everyone looks around the room, for Sephiroth.) 

Cloud 
         "Where are you! Sephiroth!" 

(Cloud runs off.) 

Aerith 
         "Wait! Cloud!" 
  
  
  





  Scene 82 
- The Black Materia - 

(Cloud is standing before the mural of Meteor as the others catch up with 
him. His body flashes with the same electricity that Sephiroth's had 
moments before.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud!!" 

(Cloud turns his head slightly toward them, then goes back to the mural.) 

Tifa 
         "Hey, Cloud!" 


(Cloud turns his head again to them, then back to the mural. Again he 
turns, then back. He starts laughing.) 

Cloud 
         "Ha ha ha.... Black Materia." 
         "Ha ha ha.... Call Meteor." 

Aerith 
         "Cloud!! Get a hold of yourself!" 

(Cloud brings his hands up and clutches his head, and we see that the 
white energy is really another double of Cloud, just like Sephiroth's 
double before. The double disappears, briefly.) 

Cloud 
         "Cloud..." 
         "I'm... Cloud..." 

(The double reappears around Cloud's body. He shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "How should I?" 

(Cloud begins to move his arms and legs randomly, assuming many different 
poses. The double does the same, and it is very apparent that the double 
is moving as another entity, totally separate from Cloud. Eventually he 
stops, and the double seems to disappear into Cloud.) 

Cloud 
         "...I remember! I remember my way." 

(Cloud turns and walks toward Aerith.) 

Aerith 
         "...Cloud." 

(Cloud shrugs.) 

Cloud 
         "Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?" 

(Aerith shakes her head.) 

Aerith 
         "...It's nothing so don't worry about it." 

(She nods toward Tifa) 

Aerith 
         "Right, Cloud! It's nothing." 

(She turns back and leans toward Cloud) 

Aerith 
         "Sephiroth got away." 

Cloud 
         "...Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying." 

(He looks up at the mural) 

Cloud 
         "So this must be Meteor, right?" 

(Aerith nods. The others both look at the mural too.) 

Tifa 
         "Is something going to fall from the sky?" 

(Aerith walks  up to the mural) 

Aerith 
         "...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying." 

(She turns) 

Aerith 
         "The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor." 
         "It finds small drifting planets with its magic." 

(She turns to Cloud) 

Aerith 
         "And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out 
entirely..." 

(The room goes dark. They all try to keep their footing as it begins to 
shake back and forth.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth!?" 

(Sephiroth speaks to them from somewhere outside the room.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha ha ha... It is not me." 

(Boss battle with Red Dragon) 

(They all recover from the battle. There is a red Summon materia floating 
nearby.) 

Cloud 
         "Any sign of Sephiroth?" 

Aerith 
         "He disappeared." 

(They grab the materia, a Bahamut summon, and go to the altar. There is a 
tiny model of the Temple floating above it.)

Cloud 
         "What is this?" 

(Aerith leans forward) 

Aerith 
         "There's something written on it." 

(She pulls back, surprised) 

Aerith 
         "...B.l.a.c.k....... M.a.t.e.r.i.a." 

Cloud 
         "Black Materia!!" 

(Aerith shakes her head) 

Aerith 
         "Hey!" 
         "...Black Materia." 
         "What should we do, Cloud?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Shake it 
         Take it 
         Leave it 

***Cloud 
         Shake it 

(He goes to the model and gives it a shake. The entire room shakes as 
well. He shrugs.) 

<//> 

Aerith 
         "Wait a minute. I'll ask!" 

(She faces away. The room begins to glow white and pink.) 

Aerith 
         "I don't understand......" 

(She walks away a few steps) 

Aerith 
         "What?" 
         "Really!?" 

(She comes back. The room stops glowing.) 

Aerith 
         "They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia." 

Cloud 
         "What do they mean?" 

Aerith 
         "So, this whole building is the Black Materia?" 

Cloud 
         "This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?" 
         "Then no one could take it." 

Aerith 
         "Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple." 
         "And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve 
a puzzle." 
         "As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too." 
         "Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand." 

Cloud 
         "So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller 
and smaller and we can take it out?" 

Aerith 
         "Yes, but there's one thing..." 
         "You can only answer puzzles inside the Temple." 
         "So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple." 

Cloud 
         "I see... the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out 
of the Temple so easily..." 

Tifa 
         "Let's just leave it, OK?" 

Cloud 
         "No. We've got to think of a way to get it out." 
         "Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies." 
         "It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black 
Materia." 

(He turns to the altar) 

Cloud 
         "This place isn't safe." 

(He touches the model. The room gives a small tremor in response.) 

Aerith 
         "So what are we going to do?" 

(Cloud thinks for a moment, until the PHS rings and brings him out of it. 
He answers.) 

         "Hi, Cloud. This is Cait Sith." 
         "I overheard the whole story!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Don't forget about me." 
         "Everything you said makes perfect sense!" 
         "You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet." 

Cloud 
         "We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia." 
         "And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either." 

Cait Sith 
         "But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do." 
         "Everyone, please trust me." 

<CHOICE> 
         I guess we have no choice 
         No way 

***Cloud 
         I guess we have no choice 
<//> 

Cait Sith 
         "All righty then! Leave it all to me!" 
         "Please hurry, you've got to get out of there!" 
         "I'll be waiting at the exit!" 

(Cloud nods. They all leave the room.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 83 
- Believe In Me - Cait Sith - 

(Cloud heads out of the mural room. At the clock room, the hands are 
instantly set to 6 and 12, allowing him passage to room 12. Inside, he 
checks the exit door.) 

Cloud 
         "It's warm..." 

(The room starts to shake.) 

Cloud 
         "This isn't good..." 

(Aerith and Tifa get away from the door, just as a Giger-esque alien 
creature bursts out of the wall behind Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud... ...behind you." 

(Boss battle with Demon's Gate) 

(After the battle, Cait Sith burts in through the door, hopping up and 
down) 

Cait Sith 
         "Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's
me!!" 
         "I'll handle the rest!"

(He spins around) 

Cait Sith 
         "Well, everyone.. Take care of yourselves!" 

(Aerith turns to Cait Sith, then looks down) 

Aerith 
         "Cait Sith..." 

(She runs over to Cloud) 

Aerith 
         "Come on, Cloud... Say something." 

(Cloud rubs the back of his head) 

Cloud 
         "I'm not good at this." 

(Cait Sith stops hopping and spins around to face Cloud.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too." 

(Aerith claps her hands) 

Aerith 
         "Why don't you read our fortunes?" 

(Cait Sith does his fortune-telling dance) 

Cait Sith 
         "Say, that's right... I haven't done it in a while, huh?" 
         "I'm so excited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me." 
         "Now, what should I predict?" 

(Aerith claps her hands, then stands over by Cloud) 

Aerith 
         "Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!" 

(Tifa turns away.) 

Cait Sith 
         "That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!" 

(She turns back) 

Cait Sith 
         "Here I go!" 

(Cait Sith does his fortune-telling dance, then stops hopping and faces 
away.) 

Cait Sith 
         "This isn't good. I can't say it." 
         "Poor Tifa." 

(Tifa turns away. Aerith runs over to Cait Sith) 

Aerith 
         "No! Tell me!" 
         "I promise I won't get mad!" 

(Tifa turns back around. Cait Sith turns to Aerith and starts hopping) 

Cait Sith 
         "Is that so? Then I'll tell you." 
         "Looks good. You are perfect for each other!" 
         "Aerith's star and Cloud's star! They show a great future!" 
         "Cloud, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher... I'll do whatever 
you want me to!" 
         "You just call me when it all happens!" 

(Cait Sith turns to the doorway, still hopping. He stops and sadly slumps 
down.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy." 
         "This is the final, final farewell!" 

(He hops off to the altar room. Aerith watches after him. The screen 
fades to black.) 

Aerith 
         "Be strong Cait Sith!!" 
  
  
  





  Scene 84 
- Cait Sith In the Shrinking Temple - 

(Cait Sith hops along the altar room.) 

Cait Sith 
         "She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel
so happy." 

(He trips and falls.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Owwww......" 

(His Moogle rights itself, and he climbs back onto it, rubbing his head.) 

Cait Sith 
         "What happened?" 

(He starts hopping again, then does his happy victory dance.) 

Cait Sith 
         "I can still move more."

(He hops to the altar.) 

Cait Sith 
         "This must be it!" 
         "The Ancients sure did a great job making this." 

(He turns to the camera and dances for a oment) 

Cait Sith 
         "I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed..." 

(He starts hopping) 

Cait Sith 
         "There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's 
only one me!" 

(He does his victory dance.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Don't forget me even if another Cait Sith comes along." 

(He turns to the altar.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet..." 

(The screen goes white.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 85 
- Cloud's Sin - 

(Cloud and the others stand outside the Temple of the Ancients. Watching. 
The camera pans up to the top of the Temple, as a great black ball of 
energy consumes it, sparking. When it fades, there is nothing left of the 
Temple but a great pit. Cloud goes to the edge of it; there is a small 
black sparkle at the bottom.) 

Cloud 
         "That's the Black Materia..." 

Tifa 
         "I'll wait here." 

(Cloud makes his way to the bottom of the pit, followed by Aerith. He goes 
over to the Black Materia.)

Cloud 
         "As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor." 

(You get the Black Materia.) 

Cloud 
         "Mmm?" 
         "Can you guys use it?" 

Aerith 
         "Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power 
to use it."



Cloud 
         "You mean lots of Spiritual energy?" 

Aerith 
         "That's right." 
         "One person's power alone won't do it." 
         "Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's 
energy..." 
         "Oh yeah!" 
         "The Promised Land!" 

Cloud 
         "The Promised Land?" 
         "No, but..." 

Aerith 
         "Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient." 

Cloud 
         "He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land." 

(The screen flashes white. When it fades, we see Sephiroth standing at the 
edge of the pit.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...Ah, but I have." 

(He floats up, over the pit.) 

Sephiroth 
         "I'm far superior to the Ancients." 
         "I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge 
and wisdom of the Ancients."
         "I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the 
extinction of the Ancients." 
         "And soon, I will create the future." 

Aerith 
         "I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!" 

(Sephiroth floats higher.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha... I wonder?" 

(The screen goes white.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Wake up!" 

(The scene fades back in, to the bottom of the pit. Cloud clutches his 
head and falls to the ground.) 

Cloud 
         "Sh... shut up!" 

(Sephiroth floats to the ground. He kneels down.) 

Sephiroth 
         "There, Cloud... good boy." 

Cloud 
         "The... Noise..." 

(We see Cloud's double standing straight as Cloud writhes on the ground 
below it. Eventually Cloud stands up and melds with the double.) 

Cloud 
         "Wa...... aaaa....aaa...." 

(Cloud begins to run, in slow motion, to Sephiroth. It takes almost half a 
minute for him to make the few feet to Sephiroth. Cloud's double just 
stands where Cloud once had. Cloud gives the Black Materia to Sephiroth. 
Sephiroth stands up and begins to laugh.) 

Sephiroth 
         ".......Well done." 

(The screen goes white as Sephiroth rockets skyward. The camera moves to 
above the pit. Cloud falls and clutches his head, trembling. Aerith goes 
over to him.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, are you all right?" 

Cloud 
         "...I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...?" 

(He straightens for a brief moment, then falls at Aerith's feet.) 

Cloud 
         "Wha... what did I do... tell me, Aerith." 

(Aerith bends down to him) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud... be strong, OK?" 

(Cloud starts writhing on the ground.) 

Cloud 
         "Urrrrrrgh... What have I done!?" 

(Aerith kneels down by him.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud... you haven't done anything." 
         "It's not your fault." 

(Cloud stands up slowly... and punches Aerith. She falls backwards and 
Cloud falls onto her, landing blow after blow.) 

Cloud 
         "I...! I'm----!" 

(Cait Sith arrives. Tifa is frantic by the edge of the pit) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud--!!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Oops! This looks like I came at a bad time!" 
         "I'm Cait Sith No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all!" 

(Cloud continues to beat Aerith.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, what are you doing!?" 

(Cloud stops and falls to one side. The screen goes white.) 

Cloud 
         "Everything is white..." 
         "What did I do? I don't remember anything..." 
         "My memory... since when...? If everything's a dream, don't 
wake me." 

(The screen goes black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 86 
- Aerith's Wood - 

(The scene fades in... a calm green forest. Aerith pokes her head around 
one tree.) 

Aerith 
         "Cloud, can you hear me?" 

(Cloud speaks, though he does not appear on screen.) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened." 

(Aerith comes out from behind the tree; we see her profile as she faces 
to the side.) 

Aerith 
         "Don't worry about it." 

Cloud 
         "...I can't help it..." 

(She goes back behind the tree.) 

Aerith 
         "Oh..." 

(She jumps out from behind another tree on the opposite side of the 
forest, not visibly walking the distance between them.) 

Aerith 
         "Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?" 

(She runs forward and wipes one eye.) 

Aerith 
         "And let me handle Sephiroth." 

(She starts giggling, turns pure white, and disappears. She comes out from 
behind yet another tree.) 

Aerith 
         "And Cloud, you take care of yourself." 

(She walks back behind the tree, off-handedly leaning back so that we just 
see her head.) 

Aerith 
         "So you don't have a breakdown, okay?" 

(She goes behind the tree. She drops down from the sky, slowly, 
puppet-like, landing very softly on the ground. Cloud also floats down, 
closer to the camera. He looks around.) 

Cloud 
         "What is this place?" 

(Aerith puts her hands behind her back and looks skyward.) 

Aerith 
         "This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called 
Sleeping Forest." 

(She looks at Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor." 
         "That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the 
Cetra, like me, can do it." 

(She turns and walks a distance into the forest. She turns back to face 
Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "The secret is just up here." 

(She shakes her head.) 

Aerith 
         "At least it should be. ...I feel it. It feels like I'm being led 
by something." 

(She cocks her head to one side and waves, cutely, femininely, childishly, 
to Cloud.) 

Aerith 
         "Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over." 

Cloud 
         "Aerith?" 

(She turns and runs off into the forest, getting smaller and smaller, 
until she disappears into the bright green sunlight. Cloud starts to run 
after her, slowly, but does not go anywhere, just as in a dream. Eventually 
he stops, and Sephiroth speaks, from somewhere.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Hmm........ She's thinking of interfering? She will be a 
difficult one, don't you think?" 

(Sephiroth floats down from above, just as Cloud did. He lands, kneeling, 
where Aerith stood moments before.) 

Sephiroth 
         "We must stop that girl soon." 

(She screen flashes white, then goes completely dark.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 87 
- Cloud's Self - 

(Cloud awakens in a bed at the inn at Gongaga village. Barret and Tifa are 
standing next to the bed.) 

Barret 
         "You look like you was havin' a nightmare." 
         "How are you feeling?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I seem to be OK 
         Not good 
         Don't really know 

***Cloud 
         I seem to be OK 

Barret 
         "That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen." 
<//> 

Tifa 
         "You know, Cloud, Aerith is gone." 

Barret 
         "Everyone's out looking for Aerith." 

(Cloud sits up in bed and shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "......City of the Ancients. Aerith is headed there." 

Barret 
         "By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?" 
         "Hey, we're goin' too." 

Cloud 
         "Only the Ancients, only Aerith can save us from Meteor..." 

Tifa 
         "Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aerith? 
If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble." 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth... already knows." 

Barret 
         "Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?" 

Tifa 
         "Let's go, Cloud." 

(Cloud shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "No." 

(He holds his head) 

Cloud 
         "I might lose it again." 
         "If Sephiroth comes near me 
         I might..." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black 
Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!" 

(Cloud lets go of his head) 

Cloud 
         "My fault?" 

Barret 
         "I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But, you don't even 
understand yourself." 
         "But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this 
train we're on, till get to the end of the line." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you even going to settle up 
with Sephiroth?" 

(Cloud clutches his head) 

Cloud 
         "No..." 

(He shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "I'm afraid." 
         "If this keeps up, I may go crazy!" 
         "I'm afraid..." 

Barret 
         "Just a damn jackass, that's what you are..." 
         "Yo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya 
think really understand themselves?" 
         "People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up." 
         "But, they go on living. They don't run away... isn't that how it 
is?" 

(Barret leaves.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... you'll come with us, right? I believe in you." 

(Tifa leaves. Cloud holds his head) 

Cloud 
         "What... am I supposed to do?" 
         "Pull out of here?" 
         "Pull out? ...To where?" 

(The camera pans down. Tifa and Barret are standing by the door to the inn. 
Tifa faces Cloud's room.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud..." 

Barret 
         "Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time." 
         "He has to decide this on his own." 

(Tifa turns to Barret. He nods) 

Barret 
         "You believe in Cloud... right?" 

(He turns and leaves. Tifa looks to Cloud's room again, then follows. The 
camera pans back up to Cloud. He is now sitting on the edge of the bed, his 
head in his hands.) 

Cloud 
         "......I'm afraid to find out the truth...? But...... why?" 

(He gets up and meets the innkeeper.) 

         "You awake?" 
         "Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until 
you woke up." 
         "You sure do have good friends." 

(He leaves the inn. Barret and Tifa are standing outside, waiting for him.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud..." 

Barret 
         "Hey, how are you?" 
         "I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?" 
         "You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?" 
         "Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is 
worry about it." 
         "Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it 
happens, it happens." 
         "I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to 
normal!" 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you." 

Cloud 
         "But..." 

Barret 
         "If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it." 

(Cloud crosses his arms for a moment and thinks.) 

Cloud 
         "...You're... right. ......He's right, isn't he?" 

Tifa 
         "Come on, let's go and find Aerith...?" 

(They all leave Gongaga village.) 








Scene 88 
- Bone Village - 

(Cloud and the others travel to Bone Village on the northern continent.) 

People in Bone Village 

     "Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers." 
         "What do you want?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Where is the City of the Ancients? 
         Do you know where Aerith is? 
         What are you doing? 

***Cloud 
         Where is the City of the Ancients? 

         "The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City." 

***Cloud 
         Do you know where Aerith is? 

         "Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went 
into the Sleeping Forest anyway." 

***Cloud 
         What are you doing? 

         "We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the 
planet." 
<//> 

         "We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We simulate 
earthquakes by using bombs, and then check the sound waves given off by 
the tremors." 

         "You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp." 
         "Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you." 
         "The girl in pink that just went in also used a Lunar Harp to get 
through." 

<CHOICE> 
         I want a Lunar Harp 
         Not interested 

***Cloud 
         I want a Lunar Harp 

         "Ask the guy in the tent below." 

***Cloud 
         Not interested 
<//> 

         "Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are 
stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that." 

         "The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right 
now the forest is asleep and anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, it 
confuses. You can go in, but you may never come out..." 
         "But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a Black Cape went in. 
You think they'll be all right?" 

(Cloud talks to the man in the tent.) 

         "The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could 
excavate it for you if you want to." 

<CHOICE> 
         Start diggin' 
         I want to buy something 
         Not right now 

***Cloud 
         Start diggin' 

         "It's not just the Lunar Harp you're after. We else are you 
having us dig for?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Lunar Harp 
         Good treasure 
         Normal treasure 

(This choice only affects what you get at the end.) 

         "All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where 
you want to dig!" 

***Cloud 
         I want to buy something 

(Sells items) 

***Cloud 
         Not right now 
<//> 

(Cloud digs for the Lunar Harp.) 

         Please push the Square button to set our staff in position. 

(Cloud sets the staff.) 

         Press the Square Button to ignite the bomb for the search. 

(Kaboom.) 

         Each staff member will calculate the tremors and face the buried 
item. In other words, the point where the staff's line of vision meets is 
the Dig Point.

(The staff spins to face a spot in the top left.) 

         Select the Dig Point by moving to the point and pressing the 
Square Button. The staff will dig and search for the item. 

(Cloud selects the Dig Point.) 

         "Now, the staff will dig here. The result of the dig will be 
placed in the town treasure box overnight." 

(That night, the staff digs in the chosen spot. If you picked the spot 
correctly, the next morning Cloud finds the Lunar Harp in the treasure 
box.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 89 
- The Sleeping Forest - City Of the Ancients - 

(Lunar Harp in hand, Cloud enters the Sleeping Forest. As soon as he 
enters, we see that it is the same forest as in his dream. He progresses 
further into the forest. Reaching a clearing, the very air glows an 
ethereal green. Cloud looks around.) 

         The Sleeping Forest awoke... 

(The green fades. Cloud is treated to some beautiful, idyllic scenery as 
he travels through the Sleeping Forest. On the other side on the forest, 
he arrives at the Forgotten City. The houses, streets and walls are made 
of shells and coral, as if the city was once beneath the ocean. It is 
completely uninhabited. In one of the houses, they find several beds.)

Cid 
         "Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable." 

Tifa 
         "Shall we take a break here?" 

(They all rest for the night. The scene shifts to later that night. Cloud 
is awake, and standing away from the others. He looks up.) 

Cloud 
         "I feel it..." 

(The others come in. Cloud must have woken them up.) 

Cid 
         "Do you know what TIME it is!?" 

(Cloud turns to them.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith is here. 
         ...and so is Sephiroth." 

Cid 
         "Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?" 

Tifa 
         "But how can you tell?" 

Cloud 
         "...It's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul." 

Cid 
         "Shit, Cloud, we can't be sittin' around on our asses." 

Cloud 
         "...right. Let's hurry and find Aerith." 

(They leave the house.) 








Scene 90 
- Aerith's Gift - 

(Reaching the intersection near the entrance of the Forgotten City, Cloud 
looks to the north.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith's voice...... Coming from there?" 

(He rushes north. Passing through a tunnel, he reaches a secluded, calm, 
mirrorlike pool. Sunlight shines from above, though it is still midnight. 
He continues. He enters a small, spiral-shaped building. Taking a long, 
glass stairway there, he reaches a huge, elegant, crystalline city, 
suspended in space. Continuing on, he finds a small shrine. Aerith is 
kneeling inside it.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith?"

(There are five columns forming a path to the shrine, no wider than Cloud. 
Below them is a pool of pure, blue water. Cloud leaps onto the first 
column. The others move as if to follow, but Cloud waves them away. He 
leaps across the other columns and reaches the shrine. He steps onto the 
stairs leading up to the glass platform where Aerith kneels. The screen 
goes red for a moment. Cloud shakes his head and reaches for his sword... 
then shakes his head again and continues. He stands before Aerith. She 
does not move. He faces away and draws his sword. She still does not move. 
He turns to face her. He lifts his sword above his head. She still does 
not move. Cloud brings down his sword.) 

Cid 
         "Cloud!" 

Tifa 
         "Stop!" 

(Cloud shakes his head and steps back.) 

Cloud 
         "Ugh... what are you making me do?"

(FMV sequence. Aerith kneels in the small shrine. We see now that she is 
praying. She looks up for the first time and sees Cloud. She smiles. 
Beautifully. The camera pans up. Falling from the bright white light from 
above comes a black figure. It falls faster and faster. We see that it is 
Sephiroth. His sword is drawn. Faster he falls, straight for Aerith.)

  (His sword pierces through Aerith's body.) 

(The next few moments seem like hours. Cloud's heart pounds in his ears... 
and ours as well. Sephiroth, his sword through Aerith's body, just stares 
at Cloud. His eyes glitter, cat-like, a sly smile on his lips. With a 
great noise of grating metal, he pulls his sword from her body. Aerith 
falls forward, her eyes wide open in shock... but the smile does not 
leave her face. Then her eyes close. As she falls, her hair ribbon comes 
undone and a small materia, glowing a pale green, falls from it. It bounces 
once, emitting a small, pure sound against the glass floor. It bounces 
again, and again, until it falls off the platform into the clear water 
below.)








  Scene 91 
- Puppet - Descent Into Life - 

(Aerith's body falls forward. Cloud catches her before she hits the 
floor, cradling her in his arms. Sephiroth stands, looking skyward, his 
arms spread.) 

Cloud 
         "...Aerith." 

(He gently shakes her body.) 

Cloud 
         "This can't be real!"

Sephiroth 
         "Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's 
energy." 
         "All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for 
me over the snowy fields." 
         "There I will become a new being by uniting with the planet. As 
will this girl...

Cloud 
         "...Shut up." 

(He bows his head closer to Aerith, trembling. He abruptly looks up to 
Sephiroth.) 

Cloud 
         "The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing." 

(He slowly turns his head back to Aerith's sleeping face.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith is gone." 
         "Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry...... or get 
angry......" 

(He holds her body closer to his and bows his head forward.) 

Cloud 
         "What about us...... what are WE supposed to do?" 

(He gently rests her on the floor.) 

Cloud 
         "What about my pain?" 

(He trembles.) 

Cloud 
         "My fingers are tingling. 
         My mouth is dry. 
         My eyes are burning!" 

(Sephiroth moves for the first time. He slowly lowers his arms and looks 
at Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "What are you saying? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings 
too?" 

(Cloud quickly stands up to face Sephiroth.)

Cloud 
         "Of course! Who do you think I am!?" 

(Sephiroth starts to laugh.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha...... Stop acting as if you were sad." 
         "There's no need to act as though you're angry either." 

(He rises into the air, looking down at Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Because, Cloud. You are..."

(He rockets, spinning, high up into the air. His body becomes a tiny green 
sphere, which lands at Cloud's feet. The screen glows red. Cloud covers 
his eyes.) 

(Boss battle with Jenova-LIFE) 

(The screen goes black.) 

Jenova 
         "Because, you are...... a puppet." 

Cloud 
         "I'm...... a puppet?"

(The screen fades in. Aerith's body is resting against one wall of the 
shrine. Cid stands before her. He looks skyward as if in prayer, then 
turns and leaves. Tifa kneels next to Aerith. She reaches up and touches 
Aerith's face, her hair, then covers her mouth, squeezes her eyes shut, and 
runs off. Cloud walks over to Aerith. He gently picks her up and carries 
her to the secluded pool. FMV sequence. Cloud slowly lowers Aerith into 
the clear blue water. He releases her and slowly backs away. She floats on 
the surface for one brief second, then her face sinks beneath the water. 
Her hair fans out around her body as she descends into the deep, peaceful 
water.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 92 
- Who Am I...? - 

(The scene fades in. Cloud and the others are in one of the spiral-shaped 
shell houses in the Forgotten City. Cloud is facing away.) 

Cloud 
         "Everyone, listen to me." 

(He turns.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm Cloud, ex-SOLDIER, born in Nibelheim." 
         "I came to settle up with Sephiroth." 

Tifa 
         "...What's going on?" 

Cloud 
         "I came here by my own free will... Or so I thought." 
         "However..." 

(He gestures with his hand.) 

Cloud 
         "...To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself." 

(He turns away.) 

Cloud 
         "...There is a part of me that I don't understand." 
         "That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth." 

(He cringes away from... something) 

Cloud 
         "If you hadn't stopped me, Aerith might've been..." 
         "...There's something inside of me. A person who is not really 
me." 

(He turns back and shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "That's why I should quit this journey." 
         "Before I do something terrible." 

(He raises one fist. He is shaking.) 

Cloud 
         "But I am going." 
         "He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed Aerith, and is 
now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive... Sephiroth." 

(He stops shaking but does not lower his fist.) 

Cloud 
         "I... I must go on." 

(He lowers it.) 

Cloud 
         "...I have a favor to ask of you." 
         "Will you all come with me?" 

(He looks up and shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "...to save me from doing something terrible." 

Cid 
         "Well, we'll face it when that happens." 

(Cloud shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "I don't know how Aerith tried to save the planet from the 
Meteor." 
         "And I guess now, we'll never know." 
         "But!" 

(He nods.) 

Cloud 
         "We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back 
before Sephiroth uses it." 
         "Let's go." 

(The screen fades to black.)

     Ah, too bad I'm not a better ASCII artist. Welcome to the Final 
Fantasy VII Script.

     The way I transcribed the different choices ("I don't care / OK, let's 
go," and the like) requires a little bit of explanation:


<CHOICE>
	Do this
	Do that

***Lead character
	Do this

(Here's all the stuff that happens when you do this)

***Lead character
      Do that

(Here's all the stuff that happens when you do that)

<//>

(Here's all the stuff that happens no matter whether you do this or that)


The actual choices are somewhat more interesting.

     If you discover any grammatical errors, misspellings, or typos, or if 
you have a question, comment, or suggestion about the script, I much 
appreciate it if you email me about it so I can try to incorporate it 
into the next versions.

screenshots of the entire game is available at my website at

transcribing it. Sit back, plant your finger squarely on that down-arrow

Scene 93 
- Winter Wonderland - 

(Cloud and the others leave the shell house in the Forgotten City.) 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth... I wonder which way he went?" 

(A high-pitched whine emanates from somewhere as Cloud clutches
his head.) 

Cloud 
         "...ugh." 

(The screen goes a green tint. The camera pans up so show Sephiroth walking 
northward, then he flickers away. The camera pans back. Cloud starts 
shaking his head.)

Cid 
         "Ey, hey! You alright?" 

Cloud 
         "Hmmm..." 
         "Sephiroth said to me... Head North......... ......past the Snow 
Fields......" 

(They head north. Traversing a giant conch shell, a deep, dark cave, and a 
snow field, they arrive at the town of Winter.)

People in Winter

         "Grandpa, wake up! We have a customer!" 

         "...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came." (Sells weapons) 

         "Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one." 

         "It's almost finished!" 

         "My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here..." 
         "I never should've bought him a snowboard."

         "...whimper..... weep....." 

         "My husband left 20 years ago an still hasn't come back." 
         "He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked 
with a check on the map..." 

         "The master is an experienced climber, you know." 
         "I've heard that he knows every corner of the Great Glacier!" 

         "It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a
map." 
         "If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd 
better take that map on the wall."

         "You heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off 
limits!" 

         "What luck! We came all this way... crap!" 

         "It's colder than usual today..." 
         "It's 200 gil, you wanna spend the night?" 

         "Phew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya." 







  
  Scene 94 
- Gast's Videos - 

(Cloud goes to a small shack in the center of town. In it are many 
scientific instruments, blinking, flashing. They look out of place in this 
small town. He takes a look at them.) 

         Play the Video? 

<CHOICE> 
         No 
         Yes

***Cloud 
         The Original Crisis 

(The screen fades to black. When it fades in again, we are still in the 
same room, but the scenery is dimmed slightly green. A man dressed in a lab 
coat adjusts some of the instruments - the camera pans erratically up and 
down here - while a woman in a red dress stands by. The man finishes his 
adjustments and goes over to stand by the woman.) 

         "Camera's ready!" 
         "Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra."

(He steps away, his attention focused on her. She begins to speak.) 

         "2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the 
Planet." 
         "The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at 
the Knowlespole." 

         "Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?" 

         "Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a 
Planet-reading." 

         "Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?" 

         "...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a 
conversation with the Planet..." 
         "It said something fell from the sky making a large wound." 
         "Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet..." 
         "But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal 
itself, over many years." 

         "Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal 
the Planet?" 

(She shakes her head.) 

         "No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living 
things on this Planet becomes the energy." 
         "The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to 
diminish the needed energy..." 

         "Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts." 
         "Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its 
injury?" 

(She bows her head.) 

         "Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away 
the land... then the Planet..." 
         "The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, 
but..." 

(The doctor shrugs.) 

         "Ifalna... Let's take a break." 

(She shakes her head) 

         "I'm all right... When the Cetra... were preparing to part with 
the land they loved..." 

(She turns away) 

         "That's when it appeared!" 
         "It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead 
brothers. Showing us spectres of their past." 

         "Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't 
any idea." 

         "That's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis 
from the sky', as we call him, came." 

(She covers her face with her hands.) 

         "He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and 
finally...... gave them the virus." 

(She looks up again.) 

         "The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad... 
transforming into monsters." 

(She sinks to the floor. The scientist runs over to her) 

         "Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole." 
         "He approached other Cetra clans...... infecting them with... 
the virus..." 

         "You don't look well... Let's call it a day." 

(He walks over to the console and presses some buttons. The screen fades.) 

***Cloud 
         What is 'Weapon'?" 

(The screen fades in to show the scientist pressing buttons on the console 
again. Ifalna is this time seated in the corner. He walks closer to her.) 

         "Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?" 

         "Yes, Professor." 

(She stands and walks over to him.) 

         "The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. 
That is the 'crisis from the sky'." 
         "The Planet knew it had to destry the 'crisis from the sky'..." 
         "You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able 
to fully heal itself." 

         "Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of its own 
will?" 

         "Yes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used." 
         "A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and 
confined it." 
         "The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to 
use it." 

(He shrugs) 

         "So, Weapon no longer exists on the Planet?" 

(She shakes her head) 

         "Weapon cannot vanish. ...It remains asleep somewhere on the 
Planet." 
         "Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at 
some time..." 
         "The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still watching 
Jenova." 

         "Where is Weapon?" 

(She looks away) 

         "I don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well..." 
         "Times... have changed. The Planet... is probably watching this 
situation closely." 

(She rubs her eyes. The professor turns away, shaking his head. He looks 
almost disgusted. The turns back.) 

         "...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today." 

(He walks to the console and turns the camera off, leaving Ifalna standing 
there, her face covered in her hands.)

(The screen fades to black and remains dark as we hear the Professor and 
Ifalna speak.) 

         "What are you doing, Profes...... I mean, honey?" 

         "Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not 
working right..." 

         "What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't 
mentioned?" 

         "No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter." 
         "And when she's sleeping, her face ...looks like an angel." 

         "First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video 
later!" 

         "I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aerith. 
That's that!" 

         "You are SO selfish! But Aerith is a good name!" 
         "Hee hee... it's a good name, considering it came out of that 
forgetful head of yours!" 

         "Right!? Oh, the video tape......" 

***Cloud 
         Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth 

(The screen fades in to show the Professor working at the console again. 
Ifalna comes in and stands next to him.) 

         "Video again? You just got through taping!" 

         ".........Please don't say it that way." 
         "It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine!" 
         "Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?" 

         "If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be 
strong..." 
         "Aerith is different from the other children. I wonder what 
dangers await her...?" 

(He faces away) 

         "Never say that! I will protect you and Aerith no matter what!!" 

(He turns to her) 

         "You and Aerith are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!" 

         "I feel so much better now, darling." 
         "If I hadn't met you, I......" 

(He walks over to her and places his arms around her neck. Just as they 
are about to kiss, there comes an abrupt knock at the door. He turns) 

         "Who could that--! I was just about to..." 

(He grabs his head. Ifalna covers her face) 

         "Damn!!" 
         "How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!" 

         "I'll send them away." 

(She looks at him) 

         "Yes, at once!!" 
         "Who the devil?" 

(She goes to the door. As the opens it, cold wind blows through the room.) 

         "It, it's them!!" 

(She runs behind the Professor. Two Shinra guards rush into the
room, followed by Hojo. He walks right up to the Professor.) 

         "Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or
should I say, Cetra!" 
         "Long time no see, Professor Gast!" 

(So this is Professor Gast.) 

         "Hojo... How did you know?" 

         "Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you." 

(Hojo faces away as Gast shakes his head.) 

         "Two years I waited.... That's how much I wanted this new 
sample..... Ha, ha, ha." 

(He turns back to Gast.) 

         "...New sample? You don't mean Aerith!?" 

(Gast viciously grabs onto the front of Hojo's lab coat. The two guards 
raise their guns. He freezes. Hojo pushes his arm away.) 

         "Hmm, Aerith? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha." 

(Gast holds his head.) 

         "That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra." 
         "Hojo, please leave." 

(Ifalna moves at last. She walks calmly around in front of Gast and 
kneels on the floor before Hojo.) 

         "Please, Aerith has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, 
right?" 

(Gast spins to face her) 

         "Ifalna!" 

(Hojo nods) 

         "I'll need all of you for my experiment." 

(He turns to face Gast.) 

         "You understand, don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the 
future of the Planet!" 

(Gast kneels by Ifalna.) 

         "Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!" 

         "Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my 
precious sample." 

(Hojo turns to face the camera.) 

         "Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!" 

(The guard nearest the camera spins and shoots out the camera.
The screen goes black.) 

         "Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha......" 

(A sound of a blow.) 

         "Wh... what are you doing, Professor!?" 

         "Ifalna! Take Aerith and run!!" 

(A sound of a gunshot.) 

         "Eyaaaaah... Darling......!!" 

(A pause.) 

         "Oh, and uh... don't forget the child!" 

         "Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon!?" 
         "Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure! Thank you, Professor... 
Ha, ha, ha."

  Scene 95 
- Elena - A Snowy Ride - Great Glacier - 

(Cloud exits Gast's shack in Winter. He goes north, to the steep slope 
past the town, where someone mills aimlessly around.) 

         "No, don't! It's a steep downgrade past here!" 
         "It's dangerous, please don't go!" 

<CHOICE> 
         I'm still going 
         Thanks for your kindness 

***Cloud 
         "I'm still going 

         "Damn, I was just being nice..." 
         "What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!"

(The camera pans downward. We see Elena come running into Winter. She 
turns to face her guards.) 

***Cloud 
         Thanks for your kindness 

         "No, no. I just did what came natural." 
<//> 

Elena 
         "There they are, hurry!" 

(The guards pop into the camera, flanking her) 

         "Yes ma'am!" 

(All three come running up to Cloud.) 

Elena 
         "Cloud... huff... wheeze." 
         "I won't let you go any further!" 

(Cloud shrugs) 

Cloud 
         "What's down there?" 

Elena 
         "It's a SE-CR-ET." 
         "It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss 
in like that!" 

Cloud 
         "You mean Boss... Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it." 

Elena 
         "No! Don't think you can fool me, liar!" 

Cloud 
         "I'm not lying... it was Sephiroth." 

Elena 
         "Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!" 

(Cloud scratches his head) 

Cloud 
         "Oh, man..." 

(Elena taps her foot) 

Elena 
         "Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to 
feel some pain!" 

(A guard steps forward) 

         "Just you... and me!!" 

Elena 
         "No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch." 

         "What? Yeah......" 

(Elena throws a punch, leaving the PLAYER, via a series of direction 
presses to avoid it.) 

***If you didn't avoid it... 

(Elena kneels by Cloud) 

Elena 
         "Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it..." 

(She stands) 

Elena 
         "There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway." 
         "Put them in some house in the village." 

(The screen fades to black. Cloud wakes up in Gast's laboratory.) 

***If you avoid it... 

(Elena's punch misses and she goes tumbling down the hill, cannonball 
style.) 

         "Ele... Elena!?" 

(Her guards give chase. The guy milling around the top of the mountain 
comes out from his hiding place in the trees.) 

         "What the...? They sure were weak for Shinras." 
         "Sorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was 
going to be trouble." 
         "Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me 
to teach you to ride one?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, maybe you should 
         Nope, not interested 

***Cloud 
         Yeah, maybe you should 

(He gives control directions for riding the snowboard.) 

***Cloud 
         Nope, not interested 

         "All right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt." 
<//> 

(Cloud returns to the house of the injured little boy.) 

         "I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a 
while..." 
         "Hey, I'll give you my snowboard." 
         "Tell me when you get good at it."

                                                  
                                                  

(Cloud receives the Snowboard. He takes it to the slope at the north end 
of the village and rides it to the bottom in an incredibly fun minigame. 
They all land in a heap at the bottom.) 

Cloud 
         "Ugh..." 

(He shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "I guess we're still in one piece." 
         "Everyone all right?" 

Tifa 
         "Yeah, somehow." 

Cid 
         "I can't be doin' this! Damn!" 

Cloud 
         "So where did we land?" 
         "Looks like we've jumped pretty far..." 

(Your starting point changes depending on which path you took through the 
minigame. Heading right causes you to jump farther.) 

Tifa 
         "Oh yeah, we got the map, right? Let's look at the map by 
pressing the Square button." 

Cloud 
         "It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer." 

(Cloud and the others begin to explore the frozen mountain. Everntually, 
they pass out from exhaustion and cold. They come to in a house.) 

         "You awake?" 

(A man comes down from a loft above them.) 

         "You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all
right." 
         "My name is Holzoff. I've been living here 20 years now." 
         "If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my 
story." 
         "Why don't we go to the next room and sit down." 

(They go to the next room.) 

Holzoff 
         "You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah 
         No 

***Cloud 
         No 
<//>

         "There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here 
a long time ago." 
         "That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed 
this cliff." 
         "30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on 
the other side." 
         "But, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to 
be low but..." 
         "On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air 
lowers your body temperature." 

(He faces away) 

         "Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope..." 
         "...and I didn't even notice..." 

(He turns back) 

         "Ever since then, I've settled here... continuing to challenge 
the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers." 
         "If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll 
need to take." 
         "First, check your route... It's hard to find because of all the 
snow." 
         "Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm youselves 
up." 
         "Understand?" 

<CHOICE> 
         One more time 
         Yes 

***Cloud 
         One more time 

(He explains again) 

***Cloud 
         Yes 
<//> 

         "You must've used a lot of energy getting up here... Better get 
some rest before you head out." 

(They spend the night.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 96 
- Gaea's Cliff - Mako Crater - 

(Cloud and the others wake up and leave the shack. Everyone is shivering 
outside in the snow.) 

Barret 
         "You know, I've been thinkin'...?" 

<CHOICE> 
         What is it? 
         Save it for later 

***Cloud 
         What is it? 

Barret 
         "Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature 
is." 
         "But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to... 
you know..." 
         "I tell you one thing though. If I did have to live here I'd 
change things around 'n' make it better." 
         "I guess the total opposite of this would be...... Midgar." 
         "When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad..." 

(He makes an angry motion) 

Barret 
         "Uuuuurrrrrgh!!" 
         "What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?" 

***Cloud 
         Save it for later 

<//> 

Cloud 
         "We'll secure the route. You come up later."

(Cloud heads north, to Gaea's Cliff. Traversing a long series of 
uneventful cliffsides and ice caverns, they reach a long tunnel, 
illuminated green. Something groans ahead of them.) 

         "Ugh....... Errgaahh!!" 

(A black-cloaked figure is thrown into the tunnel.) 

(Boss battle with Schizo)

(They exit the tunnel and find themselves on a narrow ledge. Climbing the 
canyon wall, they reach the summit of a huge crater. FMV sequence as they 
see Mako energy spewing pure from the crater. They head down the canyon 
wall.)

Cloud 
         "An old crater..." 
         "Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here......" 
         "Leaving a scar on the planet." 

Cid 
         "Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered up all that energy to try
an' heal itself." 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor." 
         "Next time the wound won't be so small." 

(They continue down towards the crater. Near the bottom, another 
black-cloaked figure collapses.) 

         "...b, back... to... Seph... ...i...roth..." 

(They continue, reaching a misty passe. Huge black obelisks rise
from the fog.) 

Tifa 
         "The time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?" 

(Cloud nods. She faces away) 

Tifa 
         "I, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth." 

(A pause. She turns back) 

Tifa 
         "Let's go!" 

(They continue on. Arriving at a large rock wall, they see another 
black-cloaked figure. It jumps off the wall to its death before they 
reach it. A ways further, Cloud pauses and looks up at the sky.) 

Cloud 
         "That's......!!!" 

(The scene fades.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 97 
- The Shinra Airship - 

(When the scene fades in, we are on the Shinra airship. Rufus and Scarlet 
look out the front bay window. Heidegger stands behind them.)

Rufus 
         "So, I finally found you." 

Scarlet 
         "Kyaa haa hah." 

(She turns to Heidegger) 

Scarlet 
         "Kyaa haa hah." 
         "haa hah" 
         "haa.............hah" 
         "This is incredible......" 

(Heidegger laughs) 

Heidegger 
         "This is the Promised Land the President has been searching 
for!!" 

(Rufus turns to look at him) 

Rufus 
         "But, I'll be the one who gets it." 

(He turns back to watch the clouds below.) 

Rufus 
         "Sorry, old man."

(The camera pans down. We see Hojo laughing to himself in the other corner 
of the room. Rude stands behind him.) 

Hojo 
         "Heh heh heh......" 

(He stops laughing.) 

Hojo 
         "That land is no one's." 

(He straightens. Rude turns toward President Rufus) 

Hojo 
         "It's where the Reunion will take place...... They will all 
gather here......" 
         "I wonder if I will see...... Sephiroth?" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 98 
- Reunion - The Black Materia - 

(Cloud continues on his journey to the North Crater. They reach a long 
land bridge; the wind blows so strong it is visible. Two black-cloaks 
attempt to pass the wind, then get knocked back.) 

Tifa 
         "We need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!" 

(They cross. On the other side, we see that the land bridge continues on a 
long way, twisting in on itself. Hundreds of black cloaks trudge along it, 
single file. Here and there one jumps off to its death or simply collapses 
in the way. The others walk over them. Continuing along the land bridge, 
they reach a point where they seem to be miles above the earth. Standing 
in the way is Sephiroth.)

         "This is the end for all of you." 

(There are two black cloaks kneeling on either side of him. With a swing 
of his sword, they both fall to the ground below. One bounces loudly on a 
stone protrusion before disappearing into the green mist below.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth!!!" 

(They all run forward and confront him. Sephiroth does not turn around.) 

         "This is the end!" 

         "You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness."

(The area goes dark. Sephiroth disappears, leaving only a pulsating jet of 
purple smoke. Cloud's heart pounds in our ears.) 

Cloud 
         "He disappeared!?" 

Tifa 
         "He might still be nearby......" 

(The camera pans all around as they look for Sephiroth. They see no sign; 
but now there are two jets of smoke. Suddenly, they hear Sephiroth's voice 
from... somewhere.) 

         Our purpose is to deliver the Black Materia to our master. 

(Cloud looks around.) 

Cloud 
         "Our...?" 

Cid 
         "Hey, hey, ! What's goin' on?" 

(The camera pans wildly. There are now three jets.) 

         Those who carry Jenova's cells... 

Cloud 
         "Master...!?" 

(Four jets.) 

         Of course... Sephiroth. 

(Cloud's heart pounds faster.) 

         Heh, heh, heh... 

(His heart pounds still faster and louder until he falls to his knees. The 
light suddenly returns to the area. Sephiroth is hovering above them, his 
sword drawn. He descends on the party, knocking them to the ground. He 
stands for a moment by the edge of the land bridge, his arms raised to the 
sky. Then Cloud stands, slowly. Sephiroth turns to face him, his sword 
drawn, and the battle begins.) 

(Boss battle with Jenova-DEATH) 

(Once Jenova-DEATH has been defeated, the entire party meets with Cloud at 
the land-bridge. A small black mass floats where Jenova stood.)

Cloud 
         "Jenova's cells..." 
         "...hmm. So that's what this is all about." 
         "The Jenova Reunion..." 

Tifa 
         "Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we 
were after?" 

(He shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about 
is beating Sephiroth." 

Tifa 
         "But Sephiroth is..." 

Cloud 
         "He's here. the real Sephiroth is just beyond here." 
         "It's both incredibly wicked and cruel..." 
         "But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within 
this planet's wound." 

(Cloud walks to the black mass and picks it up. The Black Materia.) 

Cloud 
         "...The Black Materia is back in our hands." 
         "Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the 
end of it." 

Tifa 
         "We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't 
you give it to someone else to hold on to?" 

(Cloud gives the Black Materia to Red XIII.) 

Red XIII 
         "You want me to take the Black Materia? ......all right, I 
understand." 

Cloud 
         "Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you." 

(He returns to Tifa. She nods.) 

Tifa 
         "Let's find Sephiroth!!" 

(Cloud turns to face the whole party) 

Cloud 
         "We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch." 

(They continue on their journey.) 








Scene 99 
- Cloud's Truth, Or Cloud's Lie? - 

(Cloud and the others continue across the land bridge. Braving more winds 
and lightning, they complete another section of the land bridge... when 
the screen goes white.) 

Tifa 
         "What is this? What happened?" 

Cloud 
         "Calm down, Tifa." 
         "Sephiroth is near. Anything could
happen." 

(When the white fades, we see Cloud approach the gates to his hometown.) 

Tifa 
         "Nibelheim..."

Cid 
         "What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?" 

(Cloud shakes his head sadly) 

Cloud 
         "This is an illusion Sephiroth made up." 
         "He's trying to confuse us." 
         "It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's 
nothing to be afraid of." 
         "Come on, let's keep going." 

Tifa 
         "Yeah, you're right..." 
         "Look!!" 

(She points to the town entrance. They all turn to look, then scatter to 
make room. Sephiroth reaches the gates to Nibelheim.) 

Sephiroth 
         "All right, let's go." 

(Sephiroth appears not to notice the others as he walks further into the 
town. He is followed by two guards and a young man with black, spiky 
hair and a huge sword on his back.) 

Cid 
         "Cloud's not here......" 

(Tifa shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "Stop... Sephiroth." 

(Cloud shrugs) 

Cloud 
         "This is so stupid..." 

(Sephiroth begins to laugh, covering his mouth in mirth, when the screen 
flashes white and all disappear save the party.) 

Cid 
         "Hey, Cloud. Let's get back to the real world, huh." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... It's just an illusion." 
         "Don't worry about it..." 

(The screen goes white. we hear the sound of rushing wind.) 

Cloud 
         "What's.. next?" 

Tifa 
         "Stop it already!!" 

Cid 
         "This is terrible..." 

(The white fades to reveal that we are still in Nibelheim. Every building 
in the town is aflame.) 

Cloud 
         "...This is what actually happened five years ago." 
         "But..." 
         "It's probably not me that's going to come out of the Shinra 
mansion." 
         "He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion." 

(We see the black-haired young man from before rush out of the Shinra 
mansion.) 

Cloud 
         "See... didn't I tell you?" 

(He slowly walks into the town, his sword drawn. Zangan is outside the 
inn, while a couple people lie on the ground.) 

Zangan 
         "Hey! It's you! You're still sane,
right?" 

(He nods.) 

Zangan 
         "Then come over here and help me!" 

(He rushes over to Zangan.) 

Tifa 
         "I don't want to... watch this. Cloud... don't watch." 

(The young man turns in place slowly, staring at the burning houses. He 
shakes his head sadly.) 

Zangan 
         "I'll check this house. You check that one over there." 

(Zangan rushes into the inn.) 

Cloud 
         "...What's wrong, Tifa? I told you before, right?" 
         "As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need 
to be scared." 

(The screen goes white again, and Cloud and the others are standing amidst 
the flames. Cid goes over to the person laying outside the inn.) 

Cid 
         "He... hey you! You alright!?" 

(He does not respond. Cid turns) 

Cid 
         "Damn! This was all made up." 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!" 

(He shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago." 
         "That's it, isn't it?" 

(A blink of white, a gong of a church bell, and Sephiroth is there.) 

Sephiroth 
         "I see you finally understand." 

Cloud 
         "What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, 
right?" 
         "But... even making me see those things won't affect me." 
         "I remember it all. The heat of the fire... the pain in my 
body... and in my heart!" 

(Sephiroth shakes his head grimly.)

Sephiroth 
         "Oh, is that so?" 
         "You are just a puppet... you have no heart... and cannot feel 
any pain..." 
         "How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?" 
         "What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is 
the illusion." 

(Cloud shrugs. He walks right up to Sephiroth.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...Do you understand?"

Cloud 
         "I don't want to understand." 

(He turns away from him.) 

Cloud 
         "But, I want to ask you one thing. Why... why are you doing 
this?"

(A blink of white. Sephiroth appears in front of Cloud, between Tifa and 
Cid, his arms raised. They run to stand beside Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha......" 
         "I want to take you back to your real self." 
         "The one who gave me the Black Materia that day..." 
         "Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so
useful?" 
         "Hojo would die if he knew." 

(Cloud steps forward) 

Cloud 
         "Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?" 

(Sephiroth lowers his arms.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Five years ago you were..." 
         "...constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim 
was burnt." 
         "A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the 
power of Mako." 
         "An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. ...That 
is your reality." 

(Cloud shrugs.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... Don't listen to him..." 
         "Close your ears! Close your eyes!" 

Cloud 
         "What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it." 
         "...I wasn't paying attention to him." 

Tifa 
         "All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie." 
         "Don't we have our memories together?" 
         "Being kids together, starlit nights..." 

(Sephiroth cocks his head toward her.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha... Tifa..." 
         "Why are you so worried and scared by those words?" 
         "Hmm... Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?" 

(She quickly turns away, without a word.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha... You look like you're not feeling well." 

(He disappears. Cloud turns to Tifa) 

Cloud 
         "...Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?" 

(She doesn't speak for a long time.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud..." 

Cloud 
         "Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right." 
         "No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that 
Sephiroth says." 

(He looks at the ground.) 

Cloud 
         "It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am." 
         "There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories." 
         "But, Tifa......." 
         "But you said, 'Long time no see, Cloud' right?" 
         "Those words will always support me." 
         "I am the one you grew up with. I'm Cloud of Nibelheim." 
         "No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth." 

(He looks up at Tifa.) 

Cloud 
         "That's why you shouldn't be so scared." 
         "No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that 
counts..." 

(He turns away. Tifa turns back towards him. She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "No, that's not true, Cloud......" 

(He shakes his head sadly and turns to face Tifa.) 

Cloud 
         "What's not? Aren't I  the same Cloud you grew up with?" 

Tifa 
         "That's not what I meant... I don't know how to say it..." 
         "Cloud, I need some time... Just give me a little time..." 

(The screen flashes white and Sephiroth is standing on the stairs down to 
the courtyards. All but Tifa turn to face him.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Cloud... Don't blame Tifa." 
         "The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the 
power of Jenova." 
         "Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating 
you." 
         "Out of Tifa's memory..." 
         "A boy named Cloud might've just been a part of them." 

(In a blink of white, he vanishes.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud..." 
         "Please... don't think right now." 

(White flash. Sephiroth is behind them.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Ha, ha, ha...... Think, Cloud!" 
         "...Cloud? Ha, ha, ha...... Oh, excuse me. You never had a name." 

(Cloud shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "Shut up... Sephiroth." 

(Sephiroth shakes his head.) 

Sephiroth 
         "You still don't understand? Then..." 

(He faces away and starts to laugh. It is the exact laugh as he might 
have made upon his first arrival to Nibelheim. He stops with a dismissive 
gesture and turns to face Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for 
Mt. Nibel?" 

(He turns to Tifa) 

Sephiroth 
         "...Tifa, you remember, right?" 

(He turns back to Cloud and raises his arms in an almost-happy gesture.) 

Sephiroth 
         "But there is no way he would know." 

(He shakes his head. Cloud shrugs) 

Sephiroth 
         "Now... what happened to that picture?" 

(He pretends to look all around, then practically skips over to the dead 
man lying in front of the inn. The photographer.) 

Sephiroth 
         ".......is this it?" 

(He turns back to Cloud.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... don't..." 

(He nods to Tifa.) 

Cloud 
         "I... should be in the picture." 
         "Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory 
world Sephiroth made up."

(He looks at the picture. Of course, the young man in the picture has 
black hair, not blond.) 

Cloud 
         "...Just as I thought." 

(He nods.) 

Cloud 
         "This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory." 
         "...Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the 
reactor. I was sixteen." 
         "The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do...? Oh yeah..." 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, I went to Tifa's room. There, I..." 

(What did you do at Nibelheim...?) 

Cloud 
         "I played the piano!" 
         "I looked in the drawers!" 
         "I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was 
excited about it." 
         "Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in 
SOLDIER." 

(A flash. Sephiroth is gone. Cloud shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "...SOLDIER, First Class?" 

(He shakes it harder.) 

Cloud 
         "...SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER?" 

(He clutches his head, trembling.) 

Cloud 
         "How did I join SOLDIER?" 

(He falls to the ground, shaking harder.) 

Cloud 
         "Why... why can't I remember?" 

(He rises to one knee.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm... I'm..." 

(He stands.) 

Cloud 
         "That's right..." 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "...I didn't have to worry about it, because I was..." 

(The screen fades to black. Silence.) 

Tifa 
         "......Cloud?" 

Cloud 
         "Let's go, Tifa. I'm... I'm all right." 
  
  
  





  Scene 100 
- Materia Tree - 

(The screen fades in to show a crystal cave at the Northern Crater. 
President Rufus enters, standing in the center of the room for a moment, 
enjoying. Scarlet enters.) 

Scarlet 
         "Wow!! That's amazing!" 

(She runs to the center of the room, to the back wall, and back, looking 
up. Hojo enters just before the camera pans past him to the ceiling of 
the cave. There is a huge, tree-like, awe-inspiring structure there. 
Sunlight diffuses through it, into the cave. One large blue stone is 
nestled in the center of it.) 

Scarlet 
         "It's all Materia!!" 

Rufus 
         "The ouside is rich with Mako energy, The inside is a treasure 
trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land." 

Hojo 
         "There is no such thing as the Promised Land. It's a legend... an 
old wives tale... ...it's utterly ridiculous." 

(The camera pans back down to show Hojo standing near Rufus. Rufus turns 
to face him.) 

Rufus 
         "Everything as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?" 
         "It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate 
scientist." 

(The entire room quakes, filled with a rumbling sound. Rufus spins.) 

Rufus 
         "What's happening?" 

Scarlet 
         "It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's 
moving!" 

(A huge, emerald green eye winks out from the wall of the cave.) 

Hojo 
         "Weapon..." 
         "Then it really does exist... I didn't believe in it." 

Rufus 
         "What does this mean?" 

(Hojo turns to face him) 

Hojo 
         "...Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet." 
         "It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to 
nothingness." 
         "That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report." 

Rufus 
         "I never saw that report... Where is it?" 

(Hojo searches a bit and holds up something in his hand.) 

Hojo 
         "Here, right here." 

(The eye winks again.) 

Rufus 
         "You keep a lot of things to yourself." 

(The screen fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 101 
- Sephiroth's Ruse - 

(The scene fades in again and we are at the land bridge. Red XIII, Barret, 
and Cait Sith are waiting there. The green wind below is rushing past at 
insane speeds.) 

Red XIII 
         "I wonder how Cloud and the others are..." 
         "It's hard to believe... such a small piece of materia is able to 
destroy the Planet..." 

(The land bridge, the others, everything vanishes in a blink of black. Red 
XIII is left hovering over the winds below. He looks around.) 

Red XIII 
         "What the!?"

(He looks another direction) 

Red XIII 
         "Is everyone all right?" 

(He makes fighting motions.) 

Red XIII 
         "What's going on?" 
         "Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!" 

(Tifa comes running in from somewhere in the wind.) 

         "Red XIII, you're here! I'm so glad!!" 

(The land bridge fades in again. Barret and Cait Sith are gone.) 

Red XIII 
         "Tifa!!" 

(He runs over to her) 

Red XIII 
         "Something is strange... Why was it dark all of a sudden and 
where is everybody?" 

         "Everyone's waiting! Cloud's in trouble!" 

(A voice from offscreen) 

         "Please come. Help us!" 

(Tifa turns in the direction they had left.) 

         "Over there!" 

(Red XIII nods) 

Red XIII 
         "R, right!" 
         "I'm not sure I understand... but I'll go if you want me to." 

(He runs off. Tifa is still standing there.) 

         "......hee hee hee... And remember..." 

(Tifa's form flickers, then vanishes. It is replaced by Sephiroth.) 

         "...the Black Materia!" 

(Sephiroth vanishes, and Barret and Cait Sith flicker back in, flat on the 
ground. They sit up, slowly, rubbing their heads.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 102 
- Identification Number - Out Of Our Grasp Once More - Weapon Rises - 

(The scene fades back to the cave in the Northern Crater.) 

Scarlet 
         "Mr. President... I've got a bad feeling about this place..." 

(Rufus turns to Scarlet) 

Rufus 
         "Hmm... perhaps we should return to the ship now." 
         "We need to prepare for the inspection anyway." 

(The screen flashes white for a moment, and Cloud is standing in the 
center of the cave.) 

Scarlet 
         "Hey!!! Where did you come from?" 

Cloud 
         "...don't know..." 

(He turns to Rufus, shaking his head) 

Cloud 
         "This place is going to get rough." 
         "Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still 
can!!" 

(Rufus flips his hair back.) 

Rufus 
         "Leave things to you? Hmph... I don't know what you mean." 

(Cloud turns away, slowly) 

Cloud 
         "This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins 
and ends." 

(Tifa runs in from the rear of the cave.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!" 

(They take no notice. Red XIII comes
running in.) 

Red XIII 
         "I'm here to help you, Cloud!" 

(Cloud stands still for a long moment, then holds his head. He is almost 
crying. He takes a few steps toward Red XIII, then stops again. Eventually 
he goes all the way over to Red XIII.) 

Cloud 
         "Thanks... Red XIII. Where's the Black Materia?" 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!" 

Red XIII 
         "It's safe. I'm holding onto it." 

(Cloud looks down.) 

Cloud 
         "I'll take it from here. Give me the... Black Materia." 

Tifa 
         "You can't hear my voice?" 

Red XIII 
         "Are you all right, Cloud?" 

(Cloud nods.) 

Red XIII 
         "Then... here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this 
thing." 

Tifa 
         "No, don't! Please... stop, Cloud!" 

(Cloud takes the Black Materia from Red XIII.) 

Cloud 
         "Thanks. ......leave the rest to me." 

(There is a long pause... then the screen blinks white, and for just a 
moment, we see Sephiroth, staring.) 

         Come on... the Black Materia 

         Please!! Just a little longer!! 

(The white fades. Cloud walks to the center of the room.) 

Cloud 
         "Everyone, thanks for everything. And... I'm sorry." 

(He faces Rufus.) 

Cloud 
         "...Sorry." 

(He faces Red XIII.) 

Cloud 
         "...Sorry." 

(He faces Tifa.) 

Cloud 
         "Especially you, Tifa. I'm really sorry." 
         "You've been good to me...... I don't know what to say..." 

(He shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "I never lived up to being 'Cloud'." 
         "Tifa... Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'Cloud'." 

(He walks forward and turns to Hojo. Tifa holds her face and sinks to the 
ground, crying.) 

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha... this is perfect!!!" 
         "It means that my experiment was a complete success!" 

(He laughs.) 

Hojo 
         "What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?" 

(Cloud shakes his head sadly.) 

Cloud 
         "Professor Hojo... I don't have a number." 
         "You didn't give me one because I was a failed experiment." 

(Hojo turns away) 

Hojo 
         "What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?" 

(Cloud speaks to his back.) 

Cloud 
         "Professor... please give me a number. Please, Professor..." 

(Hojo spins to face him.) 

Hojo 
         "Shut up, miserable failure..."

(Cloud slumps down. We hear the sound of an electrical spark, and catch 
another fleeting glimpse of Sephiroth's visage, then Cloud rises into the 
air, spinning, exactly like Sephiroth had at the Forgotten Capital. He 
shoots up to the tree-like structure at the ceiling. The screen goes 
white.) 

Rufus 
         "Who... was that?" 

Hojo 
         "...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth 
died five years ago." 
         "Jenova cells amd Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been 
combined with science and nature to bring him to life." 

(A glimpse of the materia tree.) 

Hojo 
         "...I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion 
Theory has now been proven." 

(Another glimpse.) 

Hojo 
         "You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will 
eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion." 

(Another.) 

Hojo 
         "I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have 
passed, and now the Clones have begun to return." 

(Another.) 

Hojo 
         "I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where 
Jenova is stored." 
         "But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself 
began to move away from the Shinra Building." 

(The scene fades in to show the materia tree. Cloud stands upside down on 
one of the roots, by the huge blue stone in the center.) 

Hojo 
         "But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it 
was all Sephiroth's doing." 
         "Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the 
Lifestream; he wants to maniplate the Clones himself." 

(The room seems to darken and Cloud sits down on the root, defying 
gravity. He crosses his arms on his knees.) 

         "Yes, that was how it got started." 

(The room lightens.) 

Hojo 
         "I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to 
figure it out." 

(Darkens.) 

         "I couldn't figure it out, either." 

(Lightens.) 

Hojo 
         "The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their 
final destinations." 

(Darkens.) 

         "I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth." 

(Cloud shakes his head.) 

         "I was being summoned by Sephiroth." 
         "All the anger and hatred I bore him made it impossible for me to 
ever forget him. That and what he gave me." 

(Cloud stands, upside down, on the tree root.) 

         "Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I have brought you the Black 
Materia." 
         "Show yourself to me. Where are you?" 

(Cloud turns and steps to the blue stone, which is now glowing brightly.) 

         "Sephiroth... So we finally meet again."

(He walks down (up) to the center of the tree. FMV sequence. The blue 
stone slips, then falls down, sending small stones to the floor below. We 
see that the stone is a cocoon for Sephiroth. His body sleeps inside it, 
prefectly preserved, sleeping, waiting. The scene switches back to the 
floor. Rufus and Scarlet have left. The entire room quakes violently.) 

Hojo 
         "Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!" 

(They all turn to face him.) 

Hojo 
         "This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!" 
         "They won't be diffused into the Lifestream," 
         "but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,....." 

(Tifa shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, 
don't you?" 
         "Cloud has the Black Materia!" 
         "Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is 
going to die!" 

(Rufus comes back in.) 

Rufus 
         "Whatever I say now is too little... too late... We must 
evacuate." 

(They all turn to face Rufus.) 

Rufus 
         "I want you all to come with me. There is still much more I want 
to hear." 

(The camera pans up to show Cloud preparing to hand the Black Materia to 
Sephiroth.) 

Red XIII 
         "Cloud, NO! Stop! Please!" 

(Cloud holds his head in his hands for a moment. Then he begins to spin in 
midair, rising and falling, like a marionette.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud-----!!"

(FMV sequence. The blue stone becomes a liquid, and Cloud pushes his hand, 
and the Black Materia into it. The Black Materia fuses with Sephiroth's 
body. His face maintains its expression of calmness as his whole body 
begins to spark with energy. The materia tree and the stone crumble to the 
ground as the others rush out of the cave and onto the airship. As the 
airship flies away, a beam of energy shoots from the northern craters, 
nearly knocking the party off the airship. As the beam grows and grows, we 
see what is inside it. The Weapon. It rises from the crater,  dwarfing 
the airship as it releases a beam of pure energy from its maw. The Weapon 
creates a barrier of energy around it as it rockets off across the 
continent. The airship flies off.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 103 
- Origins - Sector 7 Train Station - 

(The screen is black. All we see is a tiny Cloud, floating in space.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud..." 
         "Cloud..." 

(The tiny Cloud stands up and runs off into the blackness. Tifa runs onto 
the screen and chases him into the nothing.) 

Tifa 
         "......I didn't know what else to do. I was always like that..." 

(The scene fades in to show the Sector 7 train station. It is raining. 
Cloud, his sword across his lap, slumps by the stairway to the train 
platform. The train conductor is looking down at him as Tifa enters.) 

         "What's the matter?" 

(The screen flashes electrically white.)

Cloud 
         "ohhh..." 

         "......poor kid." 

Cloud 
         "Ooouugh......" 

(Tifa runs up to Cloud as the train conductor leaves.) 

Tifa 
         "Are you all right?"

Cloud 
         "oo... uh... agh" 

(She kneels by him and tries to lift him up. The screen flashes 
electrically white again.) 

Cloud 
         "Uh... uh... Tifa...?" 

(Again.) 

Cloud 
         "Tifa...?" 

(Again. He stands.) 

Cloud 
         "Tifa!" 

Tifa 
         "...................?" 

(She brushes his face.) 

Tifa 
         "Oh, Cloud!" 

(Cloud raises his sword in an offensive posture.) 

Cloud 
         "That's right. I'm Cloud." 

Tifa 
         "Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here!" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, it's been a while." 

Tifa 
         "What happened to you? You don't look well." 

Cloud 
         "......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay." 

(Tifa walks a short distance away. The screen flashes again. Cloud 
clutches his head, shaking, for a brief moment. He stops before Tifa 
turns around.) 

Tifa 
         "How long has it been?" 

(The screen flashes again. Three times. He grabs his head, in pain, but 
Tifa does not seem to notice.)

Cloud 
         "Five years." 

Tifa 
         "............" 

Cloud 
         "What is it?" 

Tifa 
         "...It's really been a long time." 

(The screen darkens, but does not disappear.) 

Tifa 
         "Actually, it's been seven years." 
         "You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth 
incident, and now you're a mercenary..." 
         "You told me a lot about what happened after you left 
Nibelheim..." 
         "But..." 
         "...Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about 
the things you talked about." 
         "All the things you didn't know that you should. And other things 
you shouldn't know that you did..." 
         "I wanted to make sure..." 
         "But then I heard... you were going far away..." 

(The screen finally goes to black.) 

Tifa 
         "And I didn't want that..." 
         "I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time." 
         "And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to 
be with you, watch you." 

(The screen goes white. We hear the cry of the planet we heard at 
Bugenhagen's observatory.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 104 
- Dark Sun - 

(The white screen fades in just enough to make out Tifa's form, lying on 
the floor, or a bed.) 

Tifa 
         "Ding..." 

Barret 
         "Huh? 

Tifa 
         "The glare..." 

Barret 
         "You'll be better soon. You've been asleep a long time." 

Tifa 
         "I'm hungry..." 

Barret 
         "Hey, why don't you ask?" 
         "About him." 

(The scene fades the rest of the way in. Tifa has been lying on something 
resembling an operating table, in an auxiliary room in Junon. Slowly, she 
sits up. She looks at Barret, standing by the far wall.) 

Tifa 
         "...Because I'm scared." 

Barret 
         "Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either." 

(He scratches his head.) 

Barret 
         "Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry..." 
         "None of them know if he's all right or not." 

Tifa 
         "He's still... alive, right?" 

(A pause. Barret nods) 

Tifa 
         "How long... was I asleep?" 

Barret 
         "Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days."

Tifa 
         "What about Sephiroth?" 

(Barret walks over to Tifa's bed.) 

Barret 
         "You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the 
Northern Cave?" 

(Tifa swings her legs over so that she is sitting on the edge of the bed.)

Barret 
         "Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of 
light." 
         "Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by 
the barrier."
         "We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he 
wakes up." 

(He faces a wall.) 

Barret 
         "And on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a
rampage."


(She looks at Barret) 

Tifa 
         "...Weapon?" 

(Barret turns to face her) 

Barret 
         "Remember that huge monster that was made with Sephiroth, at the 
bottom of the crater?" 
         "Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from 
the past." 

Tifa 
         "Weapon... is protecting Sephiroth?" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Barret 
         "Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up." 
         "Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got 
guts." 

(He turns and walks away. Tifa hops off the bed.) 

Barret 
         "We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no 
time..." 

Tifa 
         "Time..." 

(She turns to him.) 

Tifa 
         "...Hey! How about Meteor?"

(Barret doesn't say anything. Instead, he walks further away and presses a 
button. The window shades open up. FMV sequence. The camera sweeps past 
the room to the window, and past Barret's profile we see Meteor hanging 
in the sky like a dark sun.) 

Tifa 
         "Do we have to give up?" 

Barret 
         "...Dunno." 

(The door to the room slides open with a hiss and President Rufus walks 
in.) 

Rufus 
         "I thought Cloud would show up to save you all..." 
         "Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too." 

Tifa 
         "What are you going to do to Cloud?" 

Rufus 
         "Sephiroth's alter ego..." 

(He flips his hair.) 

Rufus 
         "Meteor has been summoned... Essentially, it's all but over now." 
         "So, there's no need for you now." 
         "No, maybe there is an important task for you..." 

(Heidegger enters behind Rufus.) 

Heidegger 
         "President! Preparations for the public execution are complete." 

(Barret jumps) 

Barret 
         "Execution!?" 
         "What're ya gonna get by executin' us?" 

Rufus 
         "You are to be executed for causing this situation." 
         "People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is 
punished." 

(Barret runs forward, up to the President, trembling with rage.) 

Barret 
         "I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!" 

(He straightens.) 

Rufus 
         "Well, enjoy your last moments
together." 

(With that, he turns and leaves.) 

Heidegger 
         "I'll tie your arms now." 

(He does so. A guard leads Barret and Tifa through the Military Base Junon 
to the bottom floor, where the gas chamber awaits.)








Scene 105 
- Public Execution - Weapon Attacks - Camaderie - Cheating Death - 
Highwind - 

(Barret and Tifa are led, bound, to the bottom floor of Junon Military 
Base. To the gas chamber. They arrive at a large auditorium, with rows 
upon rows of seats available to watch the event. A rather large, round 
fellow sits in the front row. Scarlet speaks at a podium.) 

Scarlet 
         "Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness 
into the world!" 

(Several cameramen set up their cameras. Barret looks around at them)

Barret 
         "The hell are these people?" 

Scarlet 
         "We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national
television." 

(The large fellow turns to her.) 

         "Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?" 

(Scarlet walks a ways toward the gas chamber) 

Scarlet 
         "With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately 
need to rally public support... it's better that we punish somebody, 
anybody." 

Tifa 
         "You make me sick..." 

(Scarlet starts laughing. A cameraman moves forward to film her.) 

Scarlet 
         "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" 
         "They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!" 

(She turns to Tifa) 

Scarlet 
         "We'll start with this girl." 

(Barret struggles against his cuffs.) 

Barret 
         "If you've gotta do it... do me first!" 

Scarlet 
         "Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats 
up tearful goodbyes!"

(A cameraman films Barret. The scene fades in to the interior of the gas 
chamber. Tifa enters, followed by Scarlet. She kicks her toward the chair.) 

Tifa 
         "What are you doing!?" 

(Scarlet moves so that Tifa is between her and the chair.) 

Scarlet 
         "This is my special gas chamber.
Take your time, and enjoy a slow, painful
death." 

(A guard moves forward and removes Tifa's cuffs. Scarlet punches her into 
the chair. The guard fastens her in.) 

Scarlet 
         "Stuck up ^%$#&!!" 

(She slaps Tifa again and leaves. The guard follows, but drops something 
on the way out. The scene fades back to the auditorium.) 

Scarlet 
         "Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha!" 

(A red light floods the room and a siren begins to sound.) 

         "Emergency! Emergency!" 
         "Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take 
your positions!" 

         "Oh no! It's Weapon!" 

(One person rushes out of the auditorium.) 

         "Run!" 

(Everyone else follows except Barret, Scarlet, the round fellow, two 
guards, and, of course, Tifa.) 

Scarlet 
         "Hey, hey, all of you!" 
         "Damn! Why now?" 

(The big round one hops up to Scarlet.) 

         "How does it feel now, Scarlet?" 

Scarlet 
         "Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right 
now......" 

(With a sound of escaping gas, Scarlet passes out.) 

Scarlet 
         "Nngaaaaaahhhh!" 

Barret 
         "Huh!? Sleeping gas?" 

(The fellow spins around, shedding his coat. It's Cait Sith. The two 
guards ready their guns.) 

         "Weirdo!!" 

(Fight sequence with the two guards) 

Cait Sith 
         "I'm here to help!" 

Barret 
         "Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?" 

(Cait Sith raises a paw) 

Cait Sith 
         "Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides... I 
hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa." 
         "I'll keep watch at the entrance." 

(Cait Sith stands by the door while Barret runs to the gas chamber 
entrance. He grabs and pulls. It doesn't budge.) 

Barret 
         "It won't open!"

(The scene fades in to President Rufus' office. Rufus is standing by his 
desk, gazing out at the sea through a huge picture window. Heidegger 
comes rushing in.) 

Heidegger 
         "It's Weapon." 

Rufus 
         "There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?" 

Heidegger 
         "I believe so. Your orders?" 

Rufus 
         "No need to ask." 

(Heidegger salutes. Three sailors dash in.) 

Heidegger 
         "We'll give it a shot from our big cannon." 

(He turns to the sailors and thrusts his fist in the air) 

Heidegger 
         "Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!" 

(He turns back to the President as the sailors run off. FMV sequence. Huge 
steel plates protect the buildings in the residential area. A huge port 
opens in the street by the sea; a smaller cannon extends from it. The huge 
main cannon rotates into place, aiming at the sea. Back in the office, one 
sailor comes back in and salutes.) 

         "Preparations complete!" 

(Heidegger nods.) 

         "The cannon..." 

(He thrusts his fist towards the bay window, to the sea.) 

         "Fire----!!!" 

(FMV sequence. The cannon releases a huge burst of energy out at the sea. 
It recedes toward the horizon; a pregnant pause as we wait for it to hit 
its mark. It does. A large explosion rises from the water, sending a tidal 
wave in all directions. The FMV ends. The scene switches to the 
President's office. Heidegger slowly lowers his arm. The scene changes to 
several points around the Base; soldiers stand expectantly, waiting, 
watching the sea. The scene switches back to the office, panning up to 
show Rufus and Heidegger once more. Both stare out at the sea. Rufus turns 
his head.) 

Rufus 
         "Did we get 'em?" 

Heidegger 
         "Seems so..." 

(Another red alarm goes off through the base. Heidegger looks around, 
disoriented.) 

         "Weapon approaching!" 
         "Speed, 50 knots!" 
         "It's heading right toward us!" 

(Heidegger looks at Rufus) 

Heidegger 
         "It can't be! We hit it dead on!" 

(Rufus turns) 

Rufus 
         "How about the cannon?" 

Heidegger 
         "It'll take time to reload." 

Rufus 
         "Then use regular firepower in the mean time!" 

(Heidegger runs toward the door and thrusts his fist in the air) 

Heidegger 
         "Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it 
land!" 

(FMV sequence. Weapon closes in through the water, fishlike, rising out of 
the water. Soldiers placed all around the Base fire their weapons. The 
smaller, secondary cannons fire energy bursts at the Weapon. None have any 
effect. It comes closer. Soldiers switch to their bazookas, sending 
trails of smoke towards the Weapon, ending in explosions. It continues, 
ripping a huge wake in its path. Inside the President's office, Rufus 
shakes his head in disbelief and steps back from the window.) 

         "Speed: 70 knots!" 
         "Weapon closing in!" 
         "Not good! It's attacking!" 

(As Weapon almost reaches the base, the soldiers flee inside. One faints 
on the ground just before Weapon crashes into the base, creating an 
earthquake throughout. It slowly sinks back into the water. The scene 
switches back to the gas chamber. The gas jets turn on around Tifa.)

Tifa 
         "Gas!!" 

(She tries to cover her face with her arm.) 

Tifa 
         "Barret, help!!" 

(Barret screams in from outside the chamber.) 

Barret 
         "Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!" 

(She puts her head back and kicks her feet.) 

Tifa 
         "Come on! I can't hold on forever!" 

(The scene switches back to the auditorium. Barret jerks on the door a few 
more times before giving up. He pounds the door with his fist in anger.) 

Barret 
         "Shi-!" 

(He runs over to Cait Sith.) 

Barret 
         "The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this 
room first." 

(Barret turns back to the chamber door.) 

Barret 
         "Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!"

(Barret and Cait Sith run out of the auditorium. The door slams behind 
them. Barret yanks on it.) 

Barret 
         "No! They locked this too!" 

(Scarlet yells through the door.) 

Scarlet 
         "Fools. Now, you can't save the girl." 

(Barret lets go of the door.) 

Scarlet 
         "Ha, ha, ha, ha!!" 

(He bangs on the door.) 

Barret 
         "Goddammit......!!" 

(He turns to Cait Sith.) 

Cait Sith 
         "OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!" 

Barret 
         "Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance."

(They run off. Outside the base, they find a cameraman filming the action. 
As they try to pass, there is a huge flash of light. FMV sequence as 
Weapon rises out of the water, majestically deadly.)

Barret 
         "Damn, man!" 

(They continue to the airport. The airship hovers overhead.) 

Barret 
         "Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?" 

(Barret throws his fists in the air) 

Barret 
         "You damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all 
be comin' soon!" 

(Barret turns to face the only way out and rubs his gun-arm.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, better watch my back till the end... partner!" 

(He raises his gun. The scene switches back to the gas chamber. Tifa is 
still alive. She uses her feet to grab the item the guard dropped before- 
a key. She uses her teeth to unlock one hand, then the other. She rises 
from the chair.) 

Tifa 
         "Which button stops the gas...?" 

(Covering her face, she presses the button by the chair, shutting off the 
gas. She tries the door with all her strength, but it doesn't budge.) 

Tifa 
         "Open it---......" 

(There is a sudden explosion. FMV sequence. Outside, the Weapon pulls 
itself up to its full height. It shakes violently as its maw begins to 
glow, brighter and brighter, then releases a beam of pure energy at the 
Base. It lands on one tower, ripping a giant hole in the side of. The hole 
opens into the gas chamber. Weapon begins to gather energy for another 
salvo. A split second before it releases its beam, the Junon cannon- the 
Sister Ray- fires square in its face. As the smoke clears, we see the 
Weapon, sans head, sink into the ocean. The scene switches back to the 
gas chamber. There is a huge hole opening onto the side of the tower. 
Scarlet yells through the door.) 

Scarlet 
         "What d'you do? Hey! Open it!" 

Tifa 
         "First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling 
me to come out? Make up your mind!" 

(She climbs through the hole out onto the side of the tower, then nimbly 
begins to descend the side of it. Scarlet and her guards give chase, 
without much success. The guards lose their grip and tumble past Tifa to 
the ground. She jumps the last twenty feet or so and lands in a heap. 
Picking herself up, she runs blindly away. The only route available is 
directly onto the top of the Sister Ray. She arrives at the end. There is 
no way out except down.)

Scarlet 
         "Our little game of hide and seek
ends here." 

(Scarlet catches up with Tifa. She stands between Tifa and the only exit.) 

Scarlet 
         "The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by 
falling from here and crashing into the water below might be pretty 
exciting." 

(She walks up to Tifa and slaps her.) 

Scarlet 
         "Stuck up to the end!" 

Tifa 
         "Quit slapping me! You old wench!" 

(Tifa, controlled by the PLAYER, slaps back. Tifa and Scarlet exchange 
slaps and insults until Scarlet falls on her rear end.) 

Scarlet 
         "God! I can't stand it!" 

(She stands and faces the way she came.) 

Scarlet 
         "Take her away." 

(A guard comes onto the Sister Ray. Scarlet turns back to Tifa.) 

Scarlet 
         "Now it's time to pay up. I'll really drop you if you don't 
settle down!" 

(She laughs) 

Scarlet 
         "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" 

         "Run..." 

(A voice comes from somewhere up above. Tifa looks up) 

         "Run to the end of the Cannon!!" 

(Tifa does. FMV sequence. When she reaches the end of the cannon, she sees 
the Shinra airship rising before her. Barret stands on deck, waving to 
her. He grabs a rope and tosses it over the side. Tifa makes a running 
leap for it, but misses. She falls toward the ocean, but catches the rope 
at the very end as it swings toward her. The airship flies off, into the 
sunset.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 106 
- Highwind Takes To the Skies - 

(Tifa, Barret, and Cait Sith stand on the deck of the Shinra airship.) 

Barret 
         "You okay?" 

(Tifa nods) 

Tifa 
         "My cheeks hurt a bit." 
         "Forget about that, what's this all about?" 

(They both turn to Cait Sith.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Well, I'll catch the details later." 
         "In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours." 

(Barret and Cait Sith go below deck. Tifa follows. When she catches up, 
she finds them standing on a wire walkway.) 

Barret 
         "Dammit! Why didn't you tell me you could fly an airship?" 

(He turns away, shaking his head.) 

Barret 
         "I thought...... Tifa was gone for good." 

Cait Sith 
         "Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy." 
         "Come on! Everyone is waiting!" 

(The camera pans over to show Tifa. She jumps up) 

Tifa 
         "Everyone? Everyone's here?" 

(She follows them into the main navigation room. Cid comes jogging up to 
her) 

Cid 
         "Welcome to my airship- the Highwind!" 

(She walks up and looks around the room, without a word.) 

Cid 
         "What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!" 

(Red XIII, sitting by some steps, shakes his head.) 

Red XIII 
         "Cid......" 

(Cid rubs his head.) 

Cid 
         "Yeah......" 

(He turns to Tifa. She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "Not enough crew."

People on the Highwind 

Cid 
         "Well, it takes all kinds." 

Cait Sith 
         "Tifa, I'll give you information Shinra." 
         "Ask me if there's anything you don't understand." 

         "Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things 
up!" 

(Cid yells at him) 

Cid 
         "Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?" 

         "All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us." 

Red XIII 
         "Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?" 
         "Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?" 

(Barret comes running over) 

Tifa 
         "Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage......" 
         "At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "No idea at all......" 

(Cid dashes over to the pilot) 

Barret 
         "Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this!" 
         "No way we can get offa this train we're on!" 

Tifa 
         "......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine." 
         "Cloud would......" 
         "Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do." 

(She nods) 

Tifa 
         "He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.'" 

(She turns away) 

Barret 
         "Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!" 

Tifa 
         "I'm sorry Barret." 
         "I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed." 

(Barret beats his chest and runs off) 

Red XIII 
         "And Tifa...... the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was 
because......" 

(She nods) 

Tifa 
         "......I know." 
         "That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him 
again." 
  

Cid 
         "I want you to know that I didn't dislike him." 
         "Gotta admit he was a strange dude." 
         "Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn 
fool thing." 
         "And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was." 

(He rubs his head) 

Cid 
         "Everything about him from his movements to his speech were 
kinda odd." 
         "Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way." 
         "Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again 
someday, so cheer up, sis." 

(He laughs. Tifa nods) 

Tifa 
         "......I'll be able to see him someday." 

Cid 
         "If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in 
no time." 

(Red XIII bounds up) 

Red XIII 
         "......Maybe" 
         "Cloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground 
cracked and swallowed him up......" 
         "Buried in the depths of the underground......" 

Tifa 
         "Deep within the earth... are you talking about the Lifestream?" 

Red XIII 
         "The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks 
in the ocean floor." 
         "I heard that such a place exists." 

(He sits back down by the stairs.) 

Red XIII 
         "Maybe, just maybe Cloud's......" 
  

Pilot in training (LV3) 
         "Waaaah! Captain Cid!" 

Cid 
         "Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the 
ship." 
         "Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute." 
         "Oh, and Tifa......" 
         "No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared." 
         "Go to your room and get ready for our operation." 
  

Barret 
         "What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?......" 
         "We did fine without him in the beginning......" 
         "Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd 
she go to?" 
  

Cid 
         "I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so go get 
them in order." 

         "My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!"

Heidegger." 
         "Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately 
take it out on the crew." 
         "We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us." 
         "I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, 
and there's no way I was going to quit over him." 
         "Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we 
were heading towards the North Cave." 
         "Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on." 
         "And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!" 
         "And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, 
y'know, nostalgic......" 
         "He even talked to us." 
         "I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as 
warmhearted as we'd always heard." 
         "Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot 
easier." 
         "And now here we are off to save the Planet. It's true. He really 
overwhelmed me." 
         "And that's why we decided to help." 
         "After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 
'Fire! Fire!'" 
         "In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the 
Shinra." 
         "That's how it happened. ......Just a minor mutiny against our 
leaders." 
         "But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......"

finally could."

again."

         "Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, I'll take care 
of it for you." 
         "I'll take care of it for you."

  Scene 107 
- Mideel - Mind of a Friend - 

(Tifa pilots the Highwind to the southernmost continent, to the town of 
Mideel.) 

People in Mideel 

         "Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet 
little Hot Springs town." 
         "Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our 
lives." 
         "I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here 
it's still nice and quiet." 



          "But anyhow, that overgrown moon is going to fall down on us 
isn't it?" 
         "This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies 
before they're all gone!" 
         "Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it!" 

         "Welcome! We always welcome cash! What can I help you with 
today?" (Sells items) 
         "Thank you! Come again!" 

         "Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're 
things on the outside?" 
         "Between the earthquakes and Meteor...... it just might be the 
end of the world like everyone's been saying'..." 
         "Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is......"

         "You again! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?" 
         "Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!" 
         "I've got money to burn! I've been saving like mad just for a 
time like this!" 
         "C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you, move!" 

         "Welcome, this store! Very rest and recreation shop. Where you 
go?" 
         "Oh no, other customer take up everything. Not leave anything 
for you..."

         "...gah, hah, hah... dassa joke! So where you go?" (Sells materia) 
         "Thank very much! You come 'gain."

         "Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!!" 
         "We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you 
won't find anywhere else." 
         "But it's first come first served, so get yours now!" 
         "Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside." 
         "Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!" 
         "I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town 
like this. What's up with him......? ...sigh......" 

         "Oh...... there's not much time left!! You never know when that 
moon is gonna come crashing down!!" 
         "When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and 
material things!" 
         "If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!" 
         "Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!" 

         "Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What 
can I get you today?" (Sells weapons) 
         "Thank you very much! Please come again." 

         "Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your 
turn. Even the world's gotta end sometime." 
         "Everybody leaves at one time or another. And everyone gets left 
also. That's just fate..." 
         "It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So 
that's why I'm prayin' like this for all of you." 

         "You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall outta the 
sky? Is that for real?"
         "I still don't believe it! How could this be happen?" 

         "Ancient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about 
that! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!" 
         "There's tons of stuff I still gotta do! This's just ths 
beginning." 
         "And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're 
a waste!!" 

         "Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the 
accessory store part-time." 
         "Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, 
how about one?" (Sells accessories) 
         "Thank you. Stop by again." 

(Tifa hears a small squeak when she steps on a spot next to a house. She 
bends down) 

Tifa 
         "Huh......? What could that be?" 
         "There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key... 
it's hard to get out." 
         "Well, I'll just let it go for now......" 

(Tifa moves further into the town. She sees a small dog sitting in the 
shadows.) 

Tifa 
         "What's the matter? Are you all alone?" 

(He whimpers. She kneels down by him.) 

Tifa 
         "You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? 
Silly thing..." 

(She overhears two men talking next to a small house across the street.) 

         "......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here 
on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing..." 

(The camera pans up to them.) 

         "It was really sad...... but weird. He was holding this really 
long sword." 
         "I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing 
thing was those weird blue eyes....." 

Tifa 
         "Wha!?" 

(She runs over to them) 

Tifa 
         "Wh...... wait a minute!! What did you just say!?" 
         "Excuse me! That young person you were just talking about......" 

         "Yeah... a villager found him a little ways down the coast... 
It was about a week ago I think." 

         "Yeah, poor kid... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far 
away..." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!" 

Cid 
         "Heh, good job, Tifa." 

Barret 
         "You sure!?" 

Tifa 
         "So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......?" 

(One of them points up ahead.) 

         "Yeah... up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic......" 

Tifa 
         "He's alive...!" 
         "Cloud...... Cloud's alive!!" 
         "Cloud!!" 

(She dashes off to the clinic.) 

Barret 
         "Uh....? Yo, Tifa!" 

(Tifa arrives in the clinic.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!?" 

(A doctor turns to face her.) 

Doctor 
         "Here now. The way you're
running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something." 

Tifa 
         "I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care 
of here......" 

(He crosses his arms) 

Doctor 
         "A friend...?" 

(He nods) 

Doctor 
         "Oh yeah......! That young fellow!?" 
         "Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his 
condition is..." 

(Tifa turns her head towards a small room, separate only by a thin curtain) 

Tifa 
         "Here?" 

(She nods) 

Tifa 
         "Over here." 

(She runs into the next room. A nurse is taking care of someone in a 
wheelchair, hidden behind her.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud...!?" 

(The nurse moves. We see that the person in the wheelchair is indeed 
Cloud. His head is in his lap. The others come running in.) 

Tifa 
         "Oh... Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?" 

(She runs up to him. Cloud raises his head to meet her... and it falls 
down again. His head bobs like a children's toy. He looks around as if 
confused.) 

Tifa 
         "......!?" 
         "Cloud......?" 

Cloud 
         "Uh...... aaa......?" 

(His head continues to bob, cretinous.) 

Tifa 
         "Wh...... what's wrong...... Cloud......?" 

Cloud 
         "A...... Gurk......?" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud! What happened to you.....!?" 

(The doctor crosses his arms.) 

Doctor 
         "Mako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case......" 
         "It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako 
energy for a protracted period of time." 
         "He probably has no idea who or where he is now......" 
         "Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles 
away from us." 
         "Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone......" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Tifa 
         "Doctor......!!" 

Cid 
         "Damn...... that's evil." 

Barret 
         "That's bad......" 

Tifa 
         "Cloud......" 

(She kneels in front of him.) 

Doctor 
         "Ahem! Let us excuse ourselves." 

(He turns to the others.) 

Doctor 
         "Listen, would you all mind......... waiting outside?" 

Barret 
         "........." 

(They all leave Tifa alone with Cloud. The screen dims slightly. Tifa 
leans her head against his knees, crying.) 

Tifa 
         "Why......? What do you want me to do?" 
         "Please, Cloud...... Talk to me......" 
         "Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, 
please......" 

(Cloud just bobs his head.) 

Tifa 
         "I came this far believing in the memories we have together..." 
         "This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "Oh, Cloud......! I........." 

(The screen fades to black.) 
  
  

(The scene fades in. Everyone waits outside the clinic for Tifa.) 

Barret 
         "So what about him? You know...... Cloud?" 

(The doctor crosses his arms.) 

         "I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a 
case this bad..." 
         "An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his 
brain all at once......" 
         "No normal human could have survived it...... It's a miracle he 
did!" 

Barret 
         "No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed 
up here........." 

         "But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere." 
         "Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him?" 

(He turns away.) 

Barret 
         "......hope......" 
         "Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back?" 
         "What did he do for this world? What can he do for us from here 
on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......" 

         "Is something wrong?" 

(He turns to the doctor.) 

Barret 
         "No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc." 

(Tifa comes out of the clinic.) 

Tifa 
         "........." 

(All turn to face her.) 

Barret 
         "You okay?" 

Tifa 
         "Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried." 
         "And I have something I want to tell you all......" 

(She goes back into the clinic. Everyone follows her. When the others 
arrive inside, Tifa is standing near Cloud, facing away.) 

Tifa 
         "I don't care about anything else, only Cloud......" 

(She turns to face them.) 

Tifa 
         "I...... want to be by his side......" 

Cid 
         "Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, that's probably best......" 
         "For Cloud...... an' for you......" 

(She nods, but doesn't bring her head back up, looking at the floor.) 

Tifa 
         "I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......" 

(She looks up.) 

Cid 
         "Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime." 

Barret 
         "You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud." 

Tifa 
         "Right......" 

(He turns to leave, then looks at Tifa over his shoulder.) 

Barret 
         "Oh, and uh, Tifa... I don't like askin' this but......" 
         "Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?" 

(She looks at Cloud) 

Tifa 
         "Huh!? Well... that is......" 

(She shakes her head) 

Tifa 
         "No, I'm sure of it!" 

(He nods.) 

Barret 
         "Yeah......? Okay then...... Sorry for askin' that." 

Cid 
         "Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind." 

(Barret nods. The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 108 
- Shinra's Plans - Cid's Election - 

(The party is gathered on the bridge of the Highwind. Barret gazes out 
the front bay window; Cid sits sprawled on the floor.) 

Barret 
         "What're we gonna do now? What can WE do?" 

(He turns.) 

Barret 
         "Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?" 
         "An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better." 

Cait Sith 
         "Oh, I've got some news." 

Barret 
         "Yeah, what!? That you a spy?" 

(He walks up to Barret.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Yeah...... I've already told you I was." 

(He turns away.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Both Gya ha ha and Kya ha ha are up to something." 
         "Wanna eavesdrop?"

(The scene fades to black. It fades back in to the Shinra board room. 
Heidegger and Palmer are seated at the table. Reeve stands in the 
background. President Rufus flips his hair, then turns to face them.) 

Rufus 
         "Now then...... We're faced with two issues." 
         "1. Destroy Meteor. 2. Remove the barrier around North Cave and
defeat Sephiroth." 

(He points at them.) 

Rufus 
         "Any ideas?" 

Heidegger 
         "Gya haah hah hah! We already solved the first problem!" 
         "Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!" 
         "The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect 
Huge Materia from each region." 

Rufus 
         "Well......" 

(Scarlet enters.) 

Scarlet 
         "Huge Materia is a high density special type of materia made 
through a special compression process in Mako reactors." 

(She makes an "I caught a fish THIS BIG" pose) 

Scarlet 
         "The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal 

materia." 
         "Ha, ha, ha! How about that!?" 

(She crosses her arms and faces the others) 

Scarlet 
         "We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into 
Meteor." 

(She looks at Rufus) 

Scarlet 
         "That will cause a huge explosion!! Reducing Meteor literally to 
bits." 

Rufus 
         "You're going to ram into Meteor?" 
         "Do you think we have the technology to do it?" 

Scarlet 
         "Don't worry about that!" 
         "More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area." 

Heidegger 
         "We've already collected materia from Nibelheim." 
         "All that's left is "Corel" and "Fort Condor"." 
         "I've already dispatched troops to Corel." 
         "Ghaa haah hah hah!" 

(The scene fades to black, then back to the bridge of the Highwind.) 

Barret 
         "Corel!" 
         "What else can they do to Corel!?" 

Red XIII 
         "And the Huge Materia......" 
         "You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it." 
         "When our small materia hears the larger one, something should 
happen." 
         "I'm certain of it." 
         "That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight......" 

Barret 
         "Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!" 
         "Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him his Huge Materia. 
He's gonna be shocked." 

(Cait Sith bounds up to Barret) 

Cait Sith 
         "So, what are you saying, Barret?" 
         "Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to 
return." 

(Barret turns to watch the clouds for a moment, then back to Cait Sith.) 

Barret 
         "I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just... shut your 
face!" 
         "Every group's gotta have a leader." 

(He beats his chest) 

Barret 
         "An' that's me!" 
         "Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader." 
         "I never knew that till lately." 

(He walks toward Cid, then looks at the window) 

Barret 
         "An' that's what is......" 

(Cait Sith hops away, surprised) 

Cid 
         "......ZZZZ...... hmph?" 

(Cid shakes his head and stands up) 

Cid 
         "Wha? What's goin' on?" 

(Barret nods) 

Barret 
         "You been chosen to be the new leader." 

Cid 
         "Pain in the ass. Forget it." 

Barret 
         "But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you." 

(He sweeps his gun-arm) 

Barret 
         "We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!" 
         "That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can." 

(Cid considers...) 

Cid 
         "Hm..... this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna 
be just a little tough?" 

(He rubs his head) 

Cid 
         "Oh man, that went straight to my heart." 
         "I'm a man, too!" 
         "Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!" 

(Barret nods) 

Barret 
         "Awright, now here's the first job." 
         "The Operation Room's waiting for
you!" 

Cid 
         "Yeah!!" 

(He practically scampers off to the the Operation Room. Barret runs after 
him) 

Barret 
         "Yo, Cid!" 
         "When you're ready, we're headin'
for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry."  








Scene 109 
- Corel's Huge Materia - 

People on the Highwind 

         "Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, 
Captain......" 

         "Good day, Captain!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor......" 
         "I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was 
that......?" 

Red XIII 
         "Cid." 
         "Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time." 

Barret 
         "Yo, Mr. Leader! Get your pilot ass up here!" 

(Cid pilots the Highwind to North Corel.) 

People in North Corel 

         "Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gatherin' up all 
the Huge Materia." 
         "I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the 
Corel Reactor." 
  

         "Hey, what's gonna happen to the world...?" 
         "I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold 
Saucer is closing..." 

         "The next train's coming in soon." 

         "With Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference..."

         "I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and 
start a new life." 
         "If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that 
town across the river..." 

         "Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided." 
         "But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame." 

         "There was something glowing in that well over there." 
         "If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the 
Gold Saucer!" 

(Cid heads north to the Corel Reactor. Two Shinra guards at the entrance 
accost them.) 

         "You guys are...!" 

(Battle sequence with the two guards) 

Cid 
         "Guess we're safe for now...!" 

(We hear the sound of a train whistle.) 

Red XIII 
         "Ohh!" 

Barret 
         "Da---mn!" 

(They scatter to avoid the train as it rumbles out of the reactor towards 
Corel.) 

Cid 
         "Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that 
train!" 

Barret 
         "NO! You damn boneheads!" 

Red XIII 
         "Did the Shinra beat us!?" 

Cid 
         "Hey, do you know who I am?" 
         "I'm Cid - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!"

(They follow Cid as he runs into the Reactor. We hear another train 
whistle.) 

Cid 
         "Hey, hey, hey, hey---!" 

(Another small train, driven by Cid, trundles out of the reactor in 
pursuit. The scene switches to the engineer's compartment.) 

Barret 
         "How can they even drive this?" 

Cid 
         "Don't ask me... I don't know!" 

Barret 
         "What!?" 

(Cid grabs the levers in front of him) 

Cid 
         "Don't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!" 
         "Two levers; one on the right and one on the left..."

(He flips the levers) 

Cid 
         "I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?" 
         "Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 
minutes." 
         "We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!" 

(Cid, controlled by the PLAYER, begins to alternately flip the levers 
back and forth. The train gains speed until it catches up with the enemy 
train on the other track.) 

Cid 
         "All right! We're gonna jump!!"

(The party makes a flying leap and lands on the last car of the train. 
They leap from car to car, battling minibosses, until they reach the head 
locomotive. A Shinra soldier is piloting the train.) 

         "What the! You... you guys!" 

Cid 
         "All right-- Just hand over the Huge Materia!" 

         "Sh......" 
         "Whooooa----!" 

(Battle sequence with the Shinra soldier) 

Cid 
         "You got guts comin' after me!" 
         "I'll never forget you!" 

Barret 
         "Got no time for that now!" 

Red XIII 
         "We got it going, but what about the brakes?" 

Cid 
         "I KNOW, already! Just shut up and keep quiet! If we keep this 
up, we'll crash right into North Corel!" 
         "Let's see... if we alternately use the levers to accelerate..." 
         "It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!" 

(Cid, controlled by the PLAYER, moves both levers up. The train gains 
speed.)

Barret 
         "Hey, it's not working!" 

Red XIII 
         "We're gaining speed!" 

Cid 
         "^%#@! The other way!? Just watch, this time, I'll..." 

(He moves both levers down. The train gains more speed.) 

Barret 
         "Hey... HEY HEY!" 

Cid 
         "SHI-------!!" 

(He jams both levers down once more until they snap off. FMV sequence as 
the train rolls to a stop scant inches from North Corel. Cid receives the 
Huge Materia.)

People in North Corel 

         "You sure are brave. I'm impressed!" 

         "You guys are really something!" 

(The camera pans over to show many citizens of North Corel come out of 
their homes to meet the party.) 

         "Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?" 
         "The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again..." 

         "It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, 
Barret!!" 

Barret 
         "Of... of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!" 
         "No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like 
coal!" 

         "To hell with Meteor! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?" 
         "We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor!" 

         "That's it!" 

(One of them turns to a small child standing by the well.) 

         "Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fighting the 
Shinra?" 

(He nods and comes down to meet the party.) 

         "I got it out of the well. Isn't it an amazing rock!!" 

(He gives you the Ultima materia and retreats.) 

         "Must've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your 
body." 
         "I already talked to the Inn's owner, today you can rest for 
free." 

(They stay the night at the Inn.) 

People in North Corel 

         "Whenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in 
the face......" 
         "If you're comin' down, then hurry up do it!! 'Cause I'm gonna 
kick the $#@& outta ya!" 

         "What the? Don't get hit by the train!" 

         "You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway..." 

         "When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing 
stones!" 

         "I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to 
happen." 

(They leave Corel.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 110 
- Fort Condor's Huge Materia - 

(Cid and the party travel to Fort Condor A huge, majestic bird perches 
atop it. A doorman greets them as they arrive.) 

         "We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this 
battlefield." 
         "Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them." 
         "If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?" 
         "Listen I don't want to push but, if you've got something else 
to do, why don't you finish that first?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Like to help but... 
         I guess we'll help you 

***Cid 
         Like to help but... 

         "All right then...... Take care of yourselves..." 

***Cid 
         I guess we'll help you 

         "Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details." 

(He runs inside the fort. Cid follows.) 

<//>

(Climbing a rope ladder, Cid enters the main room of Fort Condor, where 
they meet an older man sitting at a wood table.) 

         "Hmmn, now this is something. I never thought anyone would climb 
up here." 
         "Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd 
better get down before you get involved." 

Cid 
         "A battlefield, we can't overlook that." 

Barret 
         "Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?" 

Red XIII 
         "Shinra again." 

         "It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you 
climbed up here." 
         "Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?" 

Cid 
         "All right, talk on!" 

         "Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?" 

Barret 
         "Huh? Something's up there?" 

Cid 
         "No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of 
it, is that the Condor?" 

         "I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a 
condor." 
         "Looks like there's a special materia up in the Mako reactor." 
         "Then came the condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid 
of it." 
         "Their plan is to get rid of the condor and the people on this 
mountain and to get the materia from the Mako Reactor." 
         "Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra 
ourselves." 
         "That's why we have hired soldiers to help us." 
         "As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by 
fighting alongside of us..." 
         "What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?" 

Cid 
         "If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do 
something if you leave it to us." 

Barret 
         "Hey! We'll come to the rescue." 

Red XIII 
         "Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand,
too." 

(They set off.) 

People in Fort Condor 

         "I'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed 
and the condors from being killed." 

         "Hello. Do your best. We will, too." (Sells materia) 

         "You hang in there!" (Sells items) 

(The party climbs another rope ladder to the top floor. A lookout surveys 
the area outside through a window.) 

         "So shall I let you in on our strategy?" 
         "The enemy is targeting this mountain's reactor and will be 
climbing to reach it." 
         "We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect the place." 
         "Well, this is all we have...... this village doesn't have any 
money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke." 
         "To hire one soldier, we need 400 gil. So, if we have 20 
soldiers, we must have 8000 gil." 
         "That is, we would like you to use your own money to hire these 
soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and give the commands." 
         "We know that we're asking is selfish. We sent out our wives and 
kids to another village. We are resigned to our fate." 
         "Let's get it back to square one. If the enemy penetrates this 
shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately." 
         "I know it's a one shot deal, but I'm asking for your help." 
         "Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?" 

(Here you may get full instructions on how to play this minigame.) 

         "Ready?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Wait 
         Okay, ready 
         Hear more 

***Cid 
         Wait 

***Cid 
         Okay, ready 

(The battle begins.) 

***Cid 
         Hear more

(Cid gets the intructions again) 

<//> 

         "This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever 
before." 

(The battle begins. This minigame is a Warcraft-style real-time strategy 
game, in which you buy your own soldiers and attack the enemy, trying to 
prevent them from reaching the top of the fort. It's a long battle, but 
eventually they win. The scene shifts back to the lookout post.) 

         "YES! We did it! That was wonderful! Thank you!! I doubt Shinra 
will attack now." 

(The watchman laughs, then spins to look out the window.) 

         "A, arrgghh......" 

(FMV sequence. The sky around the Fort darkens, and the egg the condor is 
protecting cracks, then hatches. A sphere of light envelops the condor, 
then it bursts into flame. The energy fades, and the condor screeches and 
tumbles off the side of the tower.) 

         "Th, that light just now...... The condor...... The eggs......" 
         "What!? Would you go outside and see what it was?" 

(Cid goes out to the roof of the tower. He finds that the egg has indeed 
hatched, and a not-so-tiny baby condor is sitting in the now-empty nest. 
Cid grabs a Pheonix summon materia from the ground. The baby chirps, flaps 
its wings, and clumsily takes flight. Cid goes back inside.) 

         "Gone..." 
         "Be sure and report to my father, too." 

(Cid goes back downstairs and speaks with the man seated at the table.) 

         "Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks." 
         "Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure 
you can stop in and stay any time, so be sure to drop by." 
         "Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you......" 

(He gives Cid the Huge Materia.) 

Cid 
         "Huh? What's this?" 

Barret 
         "Damn man, it's Huge Materia." 

         "The truth is, this is the matera inside the reactor." 

Cid 
         "What the hell did we fight for?" 

         "We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the 
condors." 
         "When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how 
we knew what was inside the reactor." 
         "I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked 
in and took the materia." 
         "I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. 
I'm really sorry." 

Cid 
         "Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive." 

         "I see. If you put it that way...... we're really grateful." 

Cid 
         "So the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater 
reactor in Junon?" 

Barret 
         "We gotta get there first and beat'em no matter what!" 

Cid 
         "But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always 
mess with 'em." 
         "How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a 
bit?" 

Barret 
         "You mus' mean Cloud......" 

Cid 
         "Yeah, I'm worried aobut Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care 
of the guy." 
         "How about checkin' on 'em? Down to Mideel!" 

(Several thousand gil poorer but one Huge Materia richer, they leave Fort 
Condor and head to Mideel.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 111 
- Weapon Attacks - Lifestream Revisited - 

(Cid and the others arrive in Mideel. The first sound that meets their 
ears is that of the homeless dog's whimpering. It comes trotting up to 
them as soon as they arrive and rolls over at their feet. They hurry to 
the clinic; the dog following close behind.) 

Doctor 
         "I'm sorry...... But your friend's condition remains 
unchanged......" 
         "You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take 
time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence."

(They go to the next room. Tifa still watches over Cloud. Cloud still bobs 
his head.) 

Tifa 
         "......It's no use...... I don't understand a thing, Cloud." 
         "What should I do......? What if you never recover for the rest 
of your life?" 

(A huge earthquake shakes the area. Tifa falls down.) 

Tifa 
         "Eyaaah!?" 

(Cloud slowly lifts his head up.) 

Cloud 
         "......They're...... They're...... coming......!!" 

(Cid spins to face him) 

Cid 
         "What did you say, Cloud!?" 

Cloud 
         "Uh...... aaa......?" 

(Cid spins toward the doorway.) 

Cid 
         "Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?"

(He rushes out, passing the doctor and nurse, taking a duck-and-cover 
position. Outside, the entire area quakes and flashes randomly red and 
yellow.) 

Cid 
         "What's this...!?" 
         "The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the 
earth!" 

(The planet cries.) 

Cid 
         "Damn, that's......!? This is bad.....!!" 


(Tifa comes running out of the clinic) 

Tifa 
         "Cid......!? What's wrong?" 

Cid 
         "N, nothin'!! You and Cloud get inside quick!!" 

Tifa 
         "But I......!?" 

(He crosses his arms.) 

Cid 
         "Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that 
easily."

Tifa 
         "Be careful...!" 

(She turns and runs back inside.) 

Cid 
         "Okay, here I go! Watch this!!" 

(Cid runs to the town square. The camera moves to show the Ultimate Weapon 
circling in the sky overhead.) 

Cid 
         "Damn!! That &%$^%$
Weapon!!" 
         "Of all the times to show up......!" 

(The camera pans up toward the Weapon.)

Cid 
         "OK then, come on!! You
&$^%$!" 

(Boss battle with the Ultimate Weapon) 

(The camera pans to show the Weapon circle once more, lazily, then mosey 
off.) 

Cid 
         "You &^$#&$#! You tryin' to escape?" 

(The Weapon releases one more cry and flash of energy before departing. 
The camera pans back down to the party.) 

Barret 
         "Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I wouldda smashed 
him......" 

Red XIII 
         "It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well." 

(The ground begins to quake once more. Cid shakes his head) 

Cid 
         "Damn, you gotta be kiddin'......!!" 

(The ground begins to quake more violently as the screen flashes more 
chaotically than before.) 

Cid 
         "Th, this's bad......! The main stream is kickin' up!!" 
         "Somethin' way bigger that that last one is on its way!!" 
         "No good!! Get outta here......!!" 

Red XIII 
         "But what about Tifa and Cloud!?" 

Cid 
         "Goddammit!!" 
         "You don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! 
You don't know when that stream'll blow......"

(Something in the ground gives with a bang.) 

Cid 
         "Whoa!!" 
         "There's no time, hurry!!" 

(They all go sprinting out of the town. Cid stops and turns before leaving) 

Cid 
         "Tifa!! Cloud!! Get outta here!!" 

(The scene fades back to the clinic. Tifa turns) 

Tifa 
         "This is bad...... The tremors are getting worse."

(She turns to Cloud, his head bobbing frantically.) 

Tifa 
         "Wait a minute, Cloud." 

(She runs into the main room, the nurse still duck-and-covering.) 

Tifa 
         "Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay 
here...?" 

(The doctor nods) 

Doctor 
         "Hmm...... It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open 
space." 

(Tifa runs back in and kneels in front of Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud......" 
         "I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!" 

(He bobs his assent. The Weapon roars from outside.) 

Doctor 
         "No! The structure can't take it!! Hurry!" 

Tifa 
         "Yes!" 

(She gets up and runs around behind Cloud's wheelchair.) 

Tifa 
         "Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!" 

(Bob bob. Tifa wheels him out. FMV sequence as Tifa wheels Cloud out of 
Mideel. The ground behind them cracks, then collapses, the gaps following 
them closer and closer. Just as they are about to exit the village, a 
whole section of ground gives, tilts, and falls into the Lifestream, 
taking Tifa and Cloud with it. The camera follows them down, Cloud's face 
expressionless, as they land without a splash in the rippling green of the 
Lifestream.) 








Scene 112 
- Into Darkness - 

(Tifa and Cloud slowly float downward through the green Lifestream. The 
green fades and Tifa is left spinning, somehow artificially, in black 
space. She slowly comes to a stop, then sits up as if she were sitting in 
a chair.) 

Tifa 
         "Wh, where am I......? What's happening? I......?" 

(She stands up in the nothing.) 

Tifa 
         "Where's Cloud......!? Cloud, where are you!?" 

(She slowly turns, without moving her feet, as if she were on a turntable.) 

Tifa 
         "Huh...... what......? Who......?" 

(She looks around) 

Tifa 
         "Who is it......? I can't hear......" 

(Odd noises fill the gloom, alive but not human. Tifa spins around.) 

Tifa 
         "Wait a minute......! I don't know anything about that!" 

(She turns again, slowly, in the opposite direction.) 

Tifa 
         "No! It's not me......! I'd never do anything like that!!" 

(She stands still a moment. The sounds continue. Then she clutches her 
ears and shakes her head violently.) 

Tifa 
         "No! Stop it......!! Stay back!" 

(She begins to run in a random direction, not getting anywhere but to more 
blackness.) 

Tifa 
         "Somebody...... help! Please!!" 

(She stops, her body lit up fire-red. The sounds change, becoming 
something like radio static, intermixed with the sound of machine gun fire. 
She drops to her knees, clutching her head.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, help me!!" 

(Crumpled on the ground, she begins to spin at dizzying speeds.) 

Tifa 
         "Eyaaaaghh......!!" 

(With a great, grating sound, she spirals into the blackness.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 113 
- Enter Cloud's Mind - Nibelheim, Long Ago - 

(The blackness fades. We see Tifa stand up, slowly. She is on a great 
green platform, suspended in space. The screen is dimmed slightly. Planets 
and stars are born and die in the background. Three paths lead away from 
the platform. On each one sits a twin of Cloud, his head on his knees.) 

Tifa 
         "............ Where am I......?" 

(The screen brightens. Tifa spins and looks up to see another Cloud, high 
above the platform. He is tranparent. He clutches his head, writhing in 
slow motion, suspended in midair.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!?" 
         "What is it, Cloud? What is this......!?" 

(She takes a step toward him.) 

Tifa 
         "Is this the inside of your dream? Or is it...... your...... 
subconsciousness......?" 

(She looks down.) 

Tifa 
         "You're searching, aren't you, Cloud?" 
         "Searching...... for yourself......" 
         "I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you 
back!" 

(She crosses her arms, contemplative.) 

Tifa 
         "But...... Where do we start......?" 

(She speaks to the replica of Cloud sitting to the north. Past him, we see 
the gates of Nibelheim, faded slightly, as if in a dream.) 

         "The gates of Nibelheim... Five years ago, Sephiroth passed 
through these gates......" 
         "And...... That's how it all started......" 

Tifa 
         "It connects...... to Nibelheim......?" 
         "That's right... It's probably best to start from there......" 

(Cloud stands up. Tifa comes forward, toward the gates.) 

Tifa 
         "Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll 
be right with you......" 

(FMV sequence. The camera floats past Tifa and Cloud to the gates of 
Nibelheim. Tifa arrives there.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... look." 

(She runs into the town, nodding in the direction of the courtyard.) 

Tifa 
         "Here's the well..." 

(She turns another direction.) 

Tifa 
         "And that's Gramps' Inn, too." 

(She runs back through the gates, stopping by a rusted old truck reposing 
there.) 

Tifa 
         "The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little 
kids, right?" 

(She faces back toward Cloud's mind.) 

Tifa 
         "This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?" 

(She nods.) 

Tifa 
         "It's the same as my Nibelheim That's why this place is... our 
Nibelheim."

(Cloud materializes from thin air, seated restfully on the ground. He 
stands, looking at his feet as Tifa comes over to him.) 

Tifa 
         "Five years ago... two men from SOLDIER came..." 

(She turns toward the town.) 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier." 

(She turns back.) 

Tifa 
         "Can you tell me again what happened?" 

(Cloud blinks out of existence, then reappears behind Tifa, still staring 
at his feet. She moves aside as Sephiroth comes into the town. He stands 
in the gates a moment, then turns back. He takes no notice of Cloud and 
Tifa as this movie of Cloud's memories plays out.) 

Sephiroth 
         "So how does it feel?" 

Tifa 
         "Five years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first 
time." 

Sephiroth 
         "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?" 
         "So how does it feel?" 
         "I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..." 

Cloud 
         "Ummm... how 'bout your parents?" 

Tifa 
         "So this is... the Great Sephiroth." 

Sephiroth 
         "My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. 
My father..." 

(He laughs.) 

Tifa 
         "But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold." 

Sephiroth 
         "What does it matter...?" 
         "All right, let's go." 

(He turns and takes a few steps into the town.) 

Tifa 
         "I remember, I felt a foreboding about him." 

(She turns to watch as the Cloud of five years ago, flanked by two 
soldiers, enters. The soldier on the right stops to occupy the same space 
as the present Cloud. He walks through the soldier, to the other Cloud, 
turns, and seems to meld with him as they both occupy the same space. The 
present and past Clouds flash subtly. Tifa shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "No, Cloud." 

(She turns away.) 

Tifa 
         "I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you... 
something terrible might happen." 
         "But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore." 

(With a white flash, Sephiroth, the guards, and the past Cloud disappear, 
leaving only Cloud and Tifa.) 

Tifa 
         "You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years 
ago." 

(She turns away. Cloud looks at the ground. With a white flash, the Tifa 
of then, in her kawaii cowboy hat, appears, sitting on the ground. She is 
slumped over, staring at the ground, perhaps playing with a pebble or a 
blade of grass.) 

Tifa 
         "I... waited. But, Cloud... never came." 

(The Tifa of then stands up.) 

Tifa 
         "The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another 
person..." 

(The Tifa of then stands up and dashes off into the town, not headed 
anywhere in particular. Sephiroth appears before Tifa once more.) 

Sephiroth 
         "All right, let's go." 

(He turns and walks into Nibelheim. As the screen fades to white, we catch 
a glimpse of the two soldiers and the young man with black hair, in 
Cloud's place, follow him.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 114 
- That Childhood Promise... - 

(The scene fades in to the green platform of Cloud's mind. The gates of 
Nibelheim are no longer there. The Cloud that sat there speaks with Tifa.) 

         "You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth 
wasn't...... Cloud......?" 

Tifa 
         "There's nothing......... I can say......" 
         "You must find the answer yourself......" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "If you can't...... Then you......" 
         "Take your time, Cloud. Slowly...... little by little, okay?" 

(The Cloud of Nibelheim slowly turns away. Tifa speaks to the Cloud to the 
left. Beyond him, we see the well in Nibelheim, slightly washed-out. The 
Cloud stands up.) 

         "That starry night at the well...... And our promise that 
night... What if the memory was just a lie?" 

Tifa 
         "Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly." 
         "Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come 
back...... Slowly...... little by little......" 
         "Right... like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled 
with stars......" 

(FMV sequence. Cloud and Tifa float up into space as the camera flybys to 
the well at Nibelheim , ending focused on the starry night sky. The scene 
fades to black.) 

Tifa 
         "From the beginning... OK?" 

(The scene fades in to the well, that night when Tifa and Cloud were just 
children. They stand on the well, Cloud staring at the ground.) 

Tifa 
         "Try and remember, Cloud." 

(Cloud, a child, materializes. He is sitting on the edge of the well, 
dangling his feet. Then Tifa, also a child, is there too, sitting across 
from him, exactly as on that night long ago.) 

Tifa 
         "Right, I was wearing these clothes." 
         "That's you, too. You were so small then......"

(She sits down next to her childhood counterpart, who doesn't see her.) 

Tifa 
         "...and cute." 

(She and her younger self both look at their respective versions of Cloud, 
in perfect sync.) 

Tifa 
         "Sephiroth once said..." 


(The present Tifa looks down again.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud made up his memories by listening to my stories...." 

(Young Tifa looks back down. She swings her feet.) 

Tifa 
         "Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it." 

(Young Cloud shakes his head.) 

Tifa 
         "That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just Cloud and I. We 
talked at the well..." 
         "That's why I continued to believe that you were the real 
Cloud." 

(She looks down. She swings her own feet.) 

Tifa 
         "I still believe you're the Cloud from Nibelheim..." 

(In a flash, Young Cloud disappears and reappears at the highest structure 
of the well, silhouetted against the night sky.) 

Tifa 
         "But you don't believe in yourself..." 

(Tifa and her child self both cross their legs in perfect sync, as if they 
were the same being. The present Tifa leans back to look up at young 
Cloud. The screen pans up and fades to white.) 

Tifa 
         "These memories aren't enough." 
  
  
  





  Scene 115 
- Jealousy - In My Room - 

(The screen fades back in and we are back in Cloud's subconscious. The 
Nibelheim well is no longer visible.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud, what about your other memories?" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "No, not memories." 
         "A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, 
right?" 
         "That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different 
thing......" 

(She looks down, into the endless green space.) 

Tifa 
         "But it's different from a memory locked deep within your 
heart......" 
         "That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that 
memory......" 
         "That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?" 

(She turns to the Cloud of the well.) 

Tifa 
         "I say something and you don't remember it......" 
         "But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know 
that's our memory......" 

(She nods) 

Tifa 
         "Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you..." 
         "Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the 
first place?" 
         "I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......" 

(Suddenly, the transparent Cloud high above speaks. Tifa doesn't hear.) 

         "......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed." 

(The Cloud of the well echoes these same words.) 

         "......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed." 

(The next words come only from the Cloud of the well.) 

         "I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to 
notice........." 

(Tifa nods.) 

Tifa 
         "Someone has to notice you...? ......who?" 

(The Cloud above speaks again.) 

         "Who.........? ......You know who! ......You, that's who." 

(The Cloud of the well speaks differently.) 

         "You......" 

Tifa 
         "......Me? Why!?" 

         "Tifa...... did you forget...... about those days?" 

(She turns away) 

Tifa 
         "Look...... I......" 

(She shakes her head) 

Tifa 
         "I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?" 

(For the first time, we see Cloud, as a teenager, leap down from a high 
stone column near the place where Nibelheim once could be seen.) 

         "No...... it's all right. You were having a hard time back then." 

(Teenage Cloud looks down.) 

         "You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you 
don't remember me back then." 

(Tifa walks over to him.) 

Tifa 
         "'Back then'?" 

         "It's important to me...... I hate to say it but...... It's a 
very important memory......" 
         "Do you want to see it?" 

(Teenage Cloud runs over to stand next to the third and final Cloud. Past 
him can be seen a window, without a building past it to look into. Tifa 
speaks to the Cloud seated there.) 

         "......a sealed up secret...... wish......" 
         "Tender memories...... no one can ever know........." 

(He slowly stands up and moves out of the way so that Teenage Cloud can 
run past him to stand by the window. Tifa follows him.) 

         "Do you want to know where this window goes to, Tifa?" 
         "Fine...... I'll go." 

(FMV sequence. The camera floats past Tifa and Teenage Cloud, through the 
window. We see that the window leads to Tifa's room. Inside, Tifa looks 
around. Both Teenage Cloud and an adult Cloud are there.)

Tifa 
         "My room?" 

(Young Cloud nods.) 

Cloud 
         "It was my first time there." 

Tifa 
         "Was... it?" 

Cloud 
         "I only used to look up at it from outside." 

(The screen flashes white. A teenage Tifa is now sitting on the floor at 
the foot of her bed, her head bowed on her knees.. Three boys are standing 
around her.) 

         "Hey, look!"

(The camera moves to show Tifa's window. One of the boys looks out of it.) 

         "Cloud's coming!" 

(Through the window, we see Young Cloud come running up the path. The boy 
turns to Tifa.) 

         "You think he wants to come in?" 

(Tifa looks up a moment, then puts her head back down on her knees. The
present Tifa speaks.) 

Tifa 
         "Was that the first day you came into my room?" 

(Another boy walks up to Tifa.) 

Tifa 
         "...that's right." 
         "We lived next to each other." 
         "But I really didn't know you that well." 

(The third boy comes up.) 

Tifa 
         "I've known you since we were children and I always thought we 
were close..." 

(The teenage Tifa looks up, shakes her head, then bows it back down. The 
camera switches back to the overhead view of Tifa's room.) 

Tifa 
         "Now that you mention it... I don't recall you ever being in my 
room..." 

(Young Cloud nods.) 

         "Tifa always used to be with this three-some." 

Tifa 
         "...That's right." 

(Young Cloud turns away.) 

         "I used to think... they were all stupid." 

(Tifa spins to face him.) 

Tifa 
         "What?" 

(He turns back to face Tifa.) 

         "You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing." 

(She turns to look at her former self and friends, then back to Young 
Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "But we were children, back then." 

(He turns away slowly.) 

         "...I know. I'm the one that was stupid." 
         "I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed 
into the group." 

(He turns to face Tifa dead-on.) 

         "Then later... I began to think I was different..." 
         "That I was different from those immature kids." 

(He turns away.) 

         "That then... maybe..." 

(A double of the adult Cloud, motionless up to this point, materializes. 
It stands, flashing in and out of existence. Then it speaks. Young Cloud 
doesn't seem to notice.) 

         "Just maybe, they would invite me in." 

(Tifa spins to face the double.) 

         "I thought that might happen, so I hung around..." 

(Young Cloud speaks.) 

         "I was so prejudiced. And... weak." 

(The double speaks again.) 

         "That night I called Tifa out to the well..." 
         "I thought to myself Tifa would never come, that she hated me." 

(Tifa nods.) 

Tifa 
         "Yeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised." 

(She turns to face Young Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "But..." 
         "It's true that we weren't THAT close, but..." 

(She turns to face her young self.) 

Tifa 
         "After you left town, I really thought about you a lot." 

(She holds her face in her hands.) 

         "I used to wonder how Cloud was doing." 
         "I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?" 

(She spins back to face Young Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an 
article about you." 

(Young Cloud looks down.) 

         "Thanks, Tifa." 
         "Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy." 

(Tifa nods) 

Tifa 
         "OK!" 
         "Huh?" 

(She looks at the double, then the original adult Cloud, then back to 
Young Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "What happened on this day? Was it a special day?" 

(Young Cloud does a little hop) 

         "This was the day..." 

(After a long pause, the double speaks.) 

         "Tifa's mother..." 

(The screen fades to white.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 116 
- On The Other Side Of the Mountain - 

Tifa 
         "The day Mom died..." 

(The screen fades in to show the window once more, and young Tifa sitting 
on the floor, looking very small.) 

Tifa 
         "I want... to see... mom..." 

(She stands and runs out. The scene fades to the Nibel Mountains.) 

Tifa 
         "...I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?"

(The camera pans down to show Tifa, surrounded by her three friends, on 
the mountain path. One looks ahead at the mountain, then back to Tifa.) 

         "Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there." 

         "No one crosses that mountain alive..." 

(Tifa turns to face the boy. She spreads her arms skyward.) 

Tifa 
         "How 'bout those that died?" 

(She turns.) 

Tifa 
         "Did mama pass through the mountains?" 

(Tifa walks a little way along the path, then turns back.) 

Tifa 
         "I'm going!" 

(She spins on her heel and heads down the path. Her friends  follow. Two 
of them pause, consult with each other, then one of the them turns and 
goes running home. He bumps into Cloud, who had been following, on the 
way. Cloud runs along the path, pauses to look ahead at Tifa and her two 
remaining friends continuing, then keeps following, out of sight. The 
scene fades to the bridge across the deep gorge. Tifa walks resolutely 
across it. Her two friends look at each other, then turn tail and run 
home, again brushing past Cloud. Apprehensively, he takes a step onto the 
bridge, then, without looking back, goes sprinting across it. The screen 
fades to black. When it fades in again, we see young Tifa and young Cloud 
lying crumpled on a white screen. Tifa and Cloud look on. A black 
silhouette of an adult Cloud stands in the center. Tifa goes up to the 
dark Cloud.) 

         "I don't remember what path I walked." 
         "Tifa missed her step. I ran to her... but didn't make it in 
time." 
         "Both of us fell off the cliff." 
         "Back then, I only scarred my knees, but......" 

(Tifa's father and another man from the village come running onscreen, 
shocked. Tifa's father picks her up in his arms, while the other screams 
at young Cloud.)

         "Cloud! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this!" 

(Cloud pulls himself up on one elbow.) 

         "What the hell's the matter with you!?" 

(Tifa's father carries her off.) 

         "What if she dies!?" 

(He walks after Tifa's father, leaving Cloud sitting on the ground. The 
dark Cloud speaks again.) 

         "Tifa was in a coma for seven days." 
         "We all thought she wouldn't make it." 
         "If only I could've saved her..." 
         "I was so angry... Angry at myself for my weakness." 
         "Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me..." 
         "I got out of control... I'd get into fights not even caring who 
it was." 

(The screen fades to black.) 

         "That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth." 
         "If I got strong like Sephiroth, then everyone might..." 
  
  
  





  Scene 117 
- The Truth - You Were Watching Me - A Battle of Will - 

(The scene fades in to Cloud's subconscious. A Cloud still sits on the 
steps to the window, but where young Cloud had once stood, now stands an 
adult Cloud. The dark Cloud stands alongside.) 

         "If I could just get stronger...... Then even Tifa would have to 
notice me......" 

(Tifa nods.) 

Tifa 
         "So that was it......" 
         "Sorry, Cloud." 
         "If I had only remembered more clearly what had happened, I could 
have done something sooner......" 

(The adult Cloud shakes his head.) 

         "It's not your fault, Tifa." 

(She turns away.) 

Tifa 
         "But, I remember back when we were eight!" 

(She nods) 

Tifa 
         "That's it! Now I know!" 

(She turns back to him) 

Tifa 
         "You weren't created five years ago." 
         "My childhood memories weren't all made up!" 

(She turns to the dark Cloud, then to the other.) 

Tifa 
         "Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found 
the real you!" 

(Both Clouds nod, then touch their faces, in perfect sync, as the same 
being.) 

Tifa 
         "Let's go back to Nibelheim again......!" 

(The dark Cloud walks into the normal Cloud, melding their bodies with a 
small metallic sound. The resulting adult Cloud runs toward the 
representation of the gates of Nibelheim. Tifa follows him.) 

         "The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the 
palm of our hands." 

(Tifa runs into Nibelheim and motions for Cloud to follow. As they run 
through the courtyard toward Shinra mansion, Tifa stops.)

Tifa 
         "Cloud, wait." 
         "Where are you going?" 

(Cloud turns to her.) 

Cloud 
         "......The reactor......?" 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!" 

(He runs off and Tifa follows. The screen fades to white. It fades in; we 
are at the pod room at the Nibel reactor. Tifa and Sephiroth are at the 
top of the stairs. We see them wrestle briefly with the Masamune, then 
Sephiroth wrenches it away and slashes her as he did five years ago. We 
see her fly backwards, in slow motion, landing, broken, at the bottom of 
the stairs. The black-haired young man, Zack, comes running in, his huge 
sword on his back.)

Tifa 
         "Hey! It's Cloud!" 

(The camera pans up to show Sephiroth turn without a word and enter 
Jenova's room.) 

Cloud 
         "Za......ck...... Zac......k. Zack..." 

Tifa 
         "You remembered!!" 

(Zack rushes, leaving Tifa where she lies, up the stairs, after Sephiroth. 
He sprints into Jenova's room.) 

Tifa 
         "That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!" 
         "Then, where were you, Cloud?"

(After a long, silent pause, Zack flies backward out of Jenova's room, 
landing atop one of the pods, in exactly the same position as Tifa lies.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... Did you... see it all?" 

(There is a flash of white. One of the guards that accompanied Zack runs 
into the pod room. The camera pans wildly as he glances in horror around 
the room.)

Cloud 
         "I saw...... everything......" 


(The guard dashes up the stairs to where Zack lies atop the pod. He grabs 
Zack's sword and, laying it across his back, dashes up the stairs. Inside 
Jenova's room, he rushes up to Sephiroth. Sephiroth turns just in time to
 stabbed through the stomach by the guard.) 

         "Mom... Tifa... my town... give it back..." 

Sephiroth 
         "Aaarrrgh...... who... who are you?" 

(The guard pulls his sword from Sephiroth's body. Sephiroth kneels down, 
clutching his stomach. The guard slowly backs away, shaking his head.) 

         "I had so much respect for you... I admired you..." 

(The camera pans down to show the guard, facing away from Sephiroth and 
looking down at the floor, breathing heavily.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!?" 

(The guard removes his helmet. It is Cloud.)

Tifa 
         "That's what happened..." 

(The scene fades in to the Mako fountain in the Nibel mountains. Zack 
stands in place of Cloud. Tifa walks toward the fountain, while the guard 
looks on.) 

Tifa 
         "You were there." 
         "You were watching me." 

(The scene shifts to the Mako reactor in the Nibel mountains. The guard 
blocks Tifa from entering the Mako Reactor.) 

Tifa 
         "Yeah, I remember."

(Tifa turns away, her hands on her hips.) 

Tifa 
         "Hmm... so it was you." 

(The scene fades to black.) 

Zack 
         "Hey, Cloud. If you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask 
off?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah..." 

(The scene fades in. We are on the truck carrying Zack and Sephiroth in 
search of their monster. The carsick guard is Cloud.) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah... this is... me." 
         "I... never made it as a member of SOLDIER." 

(The carsick Cloud slumps down as Zack walks energetically around the back 
of the truck, doing squat thrusts and the like.) 

Cloud 
         "I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, 
but..." 
         "I was so embarrassed...... I didn't want to see anybody." 

(The scene fades to the gates of Nibeheim. Sephiroth enters the town, 
followed by Zack, flanked by  two guards. One guard is Cloud; he has 
forgotten his helmet. He runs offscreen, then returns, masked.) 

Sephiroth 
         "How does it feel?" 
         "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?"

(The scene fades to the Nibelheim courtyard. Every building is in flames. 
The guard that was lying outside of Cloud's house moves a little.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm..." 

(The scene fades to the pod room at the Nibel reactor. Cloud, his helmet 
off, exits Jenova's room.) 

Tifa 
         "...You came. ...You kept your promise." 

(Cloud comes down the stairs and lifts Tifa's broken body. He gently 
lays her down against one of the pods.)

Tifa 
         "So you really did come when I was in trouble!" 

Cloud 
         "Sorry... I didn't get there... fast enough..." 

Tifa 
         "It's all right... Cloud." 

(The camera pans up to show Sephiroth exit Jenova's room, her decapitated 
head in one hand.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Just like you." 

(He descends the stairs, Jenova's head swinging back and forth, and leaves 
the pod room. Cloud gets up and prepares to follow, but Zack catches him 
as he leaves.) 

Zack 
         "Cloud... Kill Sephiroth..." 

(Cloud nods and leaves the pod room. The scene shifts to the entryway of 
the reactor. Sephiroth walks determinedly out of the reactor, despite his 
wound to the stomach. Cloud exits the pod room as Sephiroth reaches the 
walkway across the Mako pit of the reactor, the hole in the Lifestream.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth!" 

(Sephiroth stops, then looks back over his shoulder at Cloud. Cloud rushes 
him, preparing to kill. Sephiroth neatly stabs Cloud through the chest 
with the Masamune. He lifts the sword, and Cloud with it, off the ground.) 

Sephiroth 
         "Don't... push... your luck..." 

(Cloud dangles there for a few moments, then by sheer will alone, brings 
himself back to the ground. Sephiroth's sword arm begins to tremble. Cloud 
reaches up and grasps the sharp edge of the Masamune.) 

Sephiroth 
         "...It can't be!" 

(Cloud summons his strength. He lifts the sword, still through his chest, 
raising Sephiroth an inch above the ground, then two inches. With all his 
might, he flings the sword to the side. It slides out of his body as 
Sephiroth flies into the wall above the Mako pool. He falls down, down, 
into the Lifestream. Cloud slumps to the ground. The screen fades to 
white.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 118 
- Return To the Others - 

(The scene fades back in to Cloud's subconscious. Tifa and Young Cloud 
stand in the center of the great green platform.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud......" 

(Young Cloud turns to her.) 

         "Then... this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again......" 

(He stands straight. The three Clouds guarding Nibelheim, the well, and 
the window, translucent, all stand in unison.) 

Tifa 
         "............!?" 

(The three Clouds turn and walk forward, forming a triangle around Young 
Cloud. One by one, each steps forward, fusing with his body with a small 
metallic sound. The camera pans up, and the writhing, transparent Cloud 
high above, floats back down to earth with a hig-pitched whine. He lands 
crumpled before Tifa. She kneels next to him.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!!" 

(He tries to stand.) 

Cloud 
         "Uh...... Ah, Uh......!" 

(He flashes brightly, then loses the transparency in his body. He sits up.) 

Cloud 
         "Uh...... Tifa......" 

Tifa 
         "Oh, Cloud......! It's really you, isn't it?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah...... Tifa...... We finally...... meet again......" 

(He stands.) 

Tifa 
         "You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!" 

(He crumples to the ground.) 

Cloud 
         "Krgh......!" 

(She kneels down.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!? Are you all right!?" 

(We hear the cry of the planet. 

Cloud 
         "V, voice...... Their......"

(She shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "I see. We're... in the Lifestream aren't we?" 
         "Everyone's waiting." 
         "Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone......" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, I guess so... Come on, Tifa. Let's go home......" 

(He stands. The screen fades to black. When it fades in again, we see 
Cloud and Tifa float upwards through the green of the Lifestream. The 
screen fades to white.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 119 
- Awakening - 

(The scene fades in to show the entire party at Mideel. The town has been 
demolished; loose boards float in the green Mako pool created in the 
earthquake. Tifa and Cloud lie, dazed, on the ground.)

Barret 
         "Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?" 

Tifa 
         "u... uhh......?" 

(She sits up.) 

Tifa 
         "Barret... You came back, I......" 
         "Cloud... Where is he?" 

Barret 
         "Don't worry about him. He's a
tough one." 

Tifa 
         "Barret...... I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real 
Cloud." 

(She nods.) 

Tifa 
         "I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his 
own..." 

Barret 
         "Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him." 

(He shakes his head.) 

Barret 
         "But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady." 

(She lies back down.) 

Tifa 
         "People have so many things pent up inside of themselves..." 
         "And they can forget so many things......" 
         "Strange...... isn't it............" 

(She turns her head away.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!" 

(The screen fades to black.) 

Barret 
         "Tifa......!?" 
  
  
  
  Scene 120 
- There Ain't No Gettin' Off - 

(The scene fades in. We are in the operation room on the Highwind. The 
party is seated around the table; Cloud stands at the head of it.) 

Cloud 
         "Everyone...... I'm sorry. I don't know what to say......" 

Red XIII 
         "Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing." 

(He nods to Red XIII, then looks down at his feet.) 

Cloud 
         "I never was in SOLDIER." 
         "I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, 
about being in SOLDIER." 
         "I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to 
SOLDIER......" 
         "I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from 
my friend Zack..." 
         "And I greated an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen 
in my life....." 
         "And I continued to play the charade as if it were true." 

(He straightens and nods.) 

Barret 
         "Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say." 

(He nods to Barret.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm physically built like someone on SOLDIER." 
         "Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult." 
         "It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of 
SOLDIER." 

(He shrugs) 

Cloud 
         "You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy." 
         "Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......" 
         "For better or for worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER." 
         "It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion." 
         "But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing." 

(He looks up.) 

Cloud 
         "The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my 
own weaknesses are what created me." 
         "Everyone knew that. I'm...... Cloud." 

(He shakes his head sadly.) 

Cloud 
         "......the master of my own illusionary world." 
         "But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more......" 
         "I'm going to live my life without pretending." 

Tifa 
         "You're sure messed up, Cloud!" 

Barret 
         "That means there ain't no difference from before!" 

(Cloud rubs his head.) 

Cait Sith 
         "By the way, Cloud. What are you going to do now?" 
         "Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?" 

Cloud 
         "......I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us." 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this 
thing." 

Barret 
         "Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?" 

Cloud 
         "It's like you always told me, Barret." 

Barret 
         "Oh, uh, you mean that!" 

Red XIII 
         "What? I don't understand!" 

(All speak in unison.) 

Cloud 
         "There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!" 
Tifa 
         "There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!" 
Barret 
         "The train we on don't make no stops!" 

(They all cheer and run out of the operation room. Cloud stays behind. He 
turns to face the wall behind him, sighs, and shakes his head. Then he too 
leaves. On the way out, the pilot by the door stops him.) 

         "Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story!" 
         "I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you 
feel, Cloud!" 
         "No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!"

(Cloud chooses his party and leaves the
operation room, heading for the
bridge.When he arrives on the bridge of
the Highwind, the rest of the party is
assembled there.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Listen, Cloud." 
         "We're right in the middle of the mission for the Master Materia, 
right?" 
         "I know this's kinda outta the blue, but there's a underwater 
reactor at Junon." 
         "As fas as I can see, that's the only one left." 
         "That's that. Let's go!" 








Scene 121 
- Underwater Reactor - Sub Space - 

People on the Highwind 

Barret 
         "C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&$* around!" 
         "We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!" 

Cait Sith 
         "This's kinda on the spur of the moment, but shouldn't we oughta 
get to Junon!?" 

Red XIII 
         "I'm glad you're back with us!" 

Tifa 
         "Let's do our best, Cloud!" 

Cid 
         "I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one." 
         "I always forget who has what materia." 

(Cloud and the others travel to Junon.) 

People in Junon 

         "They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world 
and bringing it to Junon." 
         "Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes." 
         "I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I 
think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor." 
         "Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?" 

         "Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be 
destroyed." 

         "I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe 
underwater." 
         "The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe." 
         "You should be able to get to the reactor through it." 

Priscilla 
         "Who are you---?" 

 (She does a little hop) 

Priscilla 
         "Cloud!!" 
         "Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the 
Lifestream?" 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, that's right." 

Priscilla 
         "You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me 
one day."

(Cloud heads to the north end of the city, where a Shinra guard stands 
watch over a sliding door to the elevator.) 

         "If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil!" 

<CHOICE> 
         Okay, I guess 
         No way! 

***Cloud 
         Okay, I guess 

(The door slides open) 

         "Hurry up and get in!" 

***Cloud 
         No way! 

         "You're such a cheapskate." 
<//> 

(Cloud enters the elevator. He presses a switch there and is lifted to the 
next floor. He arrives in the heart of Military Base Junon, where he once 
dressed as a guard to greet Rufus.) 

People in the Base 

         "The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea 
Reactor!"

         "When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport." 
         "Get out of here before you get in the way!" 
         "What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get 
in the way either!" 

         "After they get in, they'll take it to the airport and will 
transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!" 

         "They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the 
Junon Underwater Reactor." 

         "Come on in!" 
         "Welcome!!" 
         "I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon 
really existed." (Sells materia) 

         "They're not going to get me down! Not me!!" 
         "Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me!" (
Sells items) 

         "Hey!! Stay out of the way!" 

         "I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore." 
         "I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!" 

         "Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!?" 
         "All right! You can enter!!" 

         "This is a Respectable Inn... guests only!" 
         "You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you." 

         "Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off 
some stress." 

         "Ok. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?" 

         "Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge... I mean, 
review!" 

         "I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon." 
         "Oh, of course, I was here, studying." 
         "And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach." 

         "Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here 
soused as usual."

         "I'd like to close down the shop, but we got the regulars to 
think about... I don't know what to do......" 

(They head to the long street in the middle of the base. Cloud stops and
shrugs.) 

Cloud 
         "I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing
something?" 

(He continues further into the base, reaching an underground path where a 
red officer trains a horde of blue grunts. He turns to face Cloud.) 

         "All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!" 

(The soldiers turn in perfect sync away from the officer, his back still 
turned.) 

         "Attention! Charge--!!" 

(They rush off in the other direction. The officer turns) 

         "He... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!" 

(He runs after them. Cloud shrugs and continues toward the reactor. He 
enters an elevator at the end of the underground path. A woman stands 
looking uninterested in one corner; two guards in the rear raise their 
guns.) 

         "How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?" 

         "All right, you're on!!" 
         "But... What if both of us..." 

         "Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!" 

(Battle sequence with the two guards)

(The elevator stops at the ground floor. The woman stands, waiting for her 
floor.)

         "...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!)" 

(Cloud walks past her out of the elevator. Another guard comes rushing up 
to him. A barking dog stands in the door behind him.) 

         "OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!" 

(Another follows him.) 

         "Yawn... I'm sleepy!!" 

         "For Junon!!" 

(Battle sequence with the two guards) 

(Cloud continues toward the reactor. Traversing a series of hallways and 
taking another elevator, he arrives at the ocean. He walks through a glass, 
Sea World-esque tunnel, through which he can see dolphins and schools of 
fish swim past. At the end is a small room lined with glass tubes filled 
with water. Cloud presses a switch on the wall; the door seals shut and 
the tubes empty of water. When he exits the room he is at a lower floor. 
An elevator. Cloud arrives on a narrow wire walkway; behind him we see a 
Shinra submarine docked. A mechanical arm trolleys through the huge 
warehouse, above Cloud. He continues past it, reaching another room. 
Shinra guards patrol all around. Cloud attempts to sneak by, but one guard 
catches him as he walks past.) 

         "You, you're Cloud!!" 

(Battle sequence with the guard) 

(Cloud continues; two more guards accost him.) 

         "You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!" 

(Battle sequence with the two guards) 

(Two more guards catch him at the exit.) 

         "So you WERE after the Huge Materia!" 

(Battle sequence with the two guards) 

(Cloud exits the room. He ends up on another narrow wire walkway. A huge 
metal pod stands near it. At the top is the Huge Materia.) 

Cloud 
         "!? The Huge Materia!" 

(They all look on as the mechanical arm finally arrives at its 
destination. It lowers, picks up the Materia, and trundles off.) 

Tifa 
         "They're gonna take it on that submarine!" 

Cid 
         "That's what you think! ^%$@#&#!" 

(They rush into the next room. The Shinra submarine is docked here. Reno 
stands here, his back turned to them.) 

Cloud 
         "Did we make it!?" 

(He watches as the arm slowly lowers the Huge Materia into a port on the 
sub's deck. The porthole closes it inside. Cloud runs forward, up to Reno.) 

Reno 
         "What are you doing? Help load." 

(He turns and finally sees them.) 

Reno 
         "Cloud!?" 

Cid 
         "You know I don't work for cheap!" 

Tifa 
         "Looks like we barely made it." 

Cloud 
         "Either give it to us or else." 
         "...which is it gonna be?"

Reno 
         "Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you." 

(A huge, oddly simian robot lumbers out from the shadows.) 

Reno 
         "My priority is the Huge Materia!" 

(Reno runs off. The robot assumes a fighting stance.) 

(Boss battle with Carry Armor) 

(After the battle, Cloud looks up to see that the sub has departed.) 

Cloud 
         "Damn! The submarine!" 

Tifa 
         "We have to go after it!" 

Cid 
         "Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!!" 

(Cloud rushes across the docking bay to another submarine on the other 
side. A bevy of Shinra soldiers all dash randomly around the deck. Cloud 
wades through them.) 

         "Y, you!" 

(Battle sequence with the two soldiers) 

         "You're not taking over this ship!" 

(Battle sequence with the two soldiers) 

(Cloud climbs onto the deck of the submarine and drops down the porthole 
to the interior. Three guards stand on either side. One raises his gun.) 

         "You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!" 

(Cloud turns to the other guards) 

         "Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off..." 

(Battle sequence with the three guards) 

(Cloud runs forward into the cockpit. A red officer stands behind the 
captain's chair; two blue guards leap up from their navigation seats. 
These are the people who helped you prepare for the President's parade. 
The officer starts shaking his head) 

         "NO, NO!! This is terrible!" 

(He runs to the other guards) 

         "We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!" 

(One guard turns to him) 

         "There's still so much more I've got to do!" 
         "I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!" 

         "All right!! Then make this your first victory!!" 
         "Go on, show 'em!!" 

(The guards raise their guns) 

         "Yes, sir!!" 

         "Remember you last training. Begin!!" 

(The twirl their guns) 

         "Yes, sir!!" 

(The officer turns) 

         "I'm back! An' now I got no regrets!!" 

         "ATT---ACK!!" 

Cloud 
         "Hmmmm..." 

<CHOICE> 
         Fight them 
         Take them prisoner 

(A [quite comical] battle sequence with the soldiers.) 

***Cloud 
         Take them prisoner 

(The guards sit down in the corner of the cockpit.)

(Cloud and the others run to the navigation controls. Cloud turns away) 

Cloud 
         "Someone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore." 
         "The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine..." 

(He kneels on the ground) 

Tifa 
         "What are we going to do... We stole a submarine but can't pilot 
it." 

Cid 
         "Hunka junk... just gotta do this!" 

(He fiddles with the controls. A red light starts flashing and he jumps 
up, startled) 

Cid 
         "SEE! Now you take over!"

(Cloud stands) 

Cloud 
         "Hey, you're right. I DO feel a little better driving." 
         "No sweat. Just leave everything to me." 

Tifa 
         "You can do it, Cloud!" 

Cid 
         "I'll be watchin' from here!" 

(Cloud walks up to the control panel.) 

Cloud 
         "Well, now what?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Read the manual

         Leave it alone 

***Cloud 
         Read the manual 

         "Submarine Operation Manual - Beginner's Edition" 

(Cloud gets instructions on the mission objective - sink the red submarine) 

***Cloud 
         Sit in the seat 

(He hops into the captain's chair) 

Cloud 
         "Everything seems set..."

Cloud 
         "This switch...?

         "Main screen: ON" 
         Change the screen mode. 

(The mission begins.)

***Cloud 
         Leave it alone 
<//> 

(The mission begins. Cloud pilots the submarine, sinking the red target 
sub. After winning the minigame, you acquire control of the submarine.) 

Cloud 
         "Phew--! We did it!!" 
         "The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's 
continue the search..." 

(The radio emits a blare of static, then emits a voice.) 

         "All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?" 
         "...All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?" 

Cloud 
         "Hmm...? ...Must be from Shinra." 

         "...Report, No. 2..." 

Tifa 
         "No. 2..." 
         "...I saw that written at the dock! They must mean this sub." 

Cloud 
         "All right, I'll do it." 

(He picks up the radio.) 

Cloud 
         "This is Shinra No. 2... Everything's normal." 

         "...Roger..." 
         "...Your next mission is..." 
         "...Return to Junon Dock..." 
         "...We will transport the Huge Materia from the airport..." 
         "...Those without other assignments will report for guard duty..." 
         "That is all. Over and out..." 

Cloud 
         "Junon Airport... We should make it if we hurry." 
         "Forget about the Huge Materia for now." 
         "We're climbing!" 

Cid 
         "The airport? No sweat!" 

(Cloud climbs the submarine to the surface and docks at Junon.) 








Scene 122 
- Gelnika Takes Off - Countdown to Dreams and Death - 

(Cloud exits the submarine and enters Junon. He takes the elevator up into 
the base and heads to the airport. He arrives just in time to see the 
Gelnika take off from the runway and fly off.) 

Cloud 
         "Oh no! The Huge Materia..." 

Tifa 
         "Can't we go after it?" 

Cid 
         "Where's that thing headed?" 

Cloud 
         "Rocket Town, of course." 

(They rush out of Junon and fly the Highwind to Rocket Town.) 

People in Rocket Town 

         "The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? 
But why now...?" 

         "What's young President Rufus doing by getting all those 
mechanics together?" 

         "Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come 
out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?" 

         "Would you like something to drink?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Let me hear your story 
         Not interested 

***Cloud 
         Let me hear your story 

         "Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore 
the rocket..." 

***Cloud 
         Not interested 

         "If he continues on like that, he's gonna collapse some day. 
Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack." 

<//> 

         "There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket..." 
         "Is my rocket... all right?" 

         "Mmmmm, a SPECTACLE." 

         "Is something about to happen? Oh, I'm getting excited."

(Cloud heads north, to the old rocket. Steam emanates from the engines; 
the Shinra are about to launch. Two guards standing by the stairs to the 
launch platform spot him.) 

         "Those terrorists are here!" 

(Battle sequence with the two guards) 

(Cloud runs up the stairs. More guards wait on the launch platform at the 
top.) 

         "Don't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!" 

(Battle sequence with two guards) 

(Cloud runs up to the platform. The last three guards attack) 

         "Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere! Uh un, nowhere!" 

(Battle sequence with the three guards) 

Cid 
         "Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my 
rocket!?" 
         "I'm outta here, Cloud! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right 
out of my rocket!"

(Cloud climbs the ladder to the top of the rocket. Rude, flanked by two 
guards, stands outside the rocket's door.) 

Rude 
         "...you again?" 

(He steps forward) 

Rude 
         "...We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way." 

(Battle sequence with Rude and the two guards) 

(Rude collapses on the walkway.)

Rude 
         ".......they got us." 

(Cloud strolls right over Rude and enters the rocket. Another guard is 
waiting inside.) 

         "You... you! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been 
here!!"

(Cloud motions "Back there") 

Cloud 
         "Too bad. Those guys are over there." 


         "Oh man... the Turks, being done in like that... But, I won't let 
you through!"

(Battle sequence with the guard) 

(The guard collapses on the floor. Cloud walks past into the rocket control 
room. Cid's mechanics all scurry about, fixing and adjusting things.) 

Cid 
         "Hey! What the hell're you guys doin'!?" 

(They all turn to face him.) 

         "Hey! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you came back!"

         "Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket!"

Cid 
         "Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?" 

         "We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor." 

         "Our rocket's gonna save the planet!" 

         "Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL!!" 

Cloud 
         "Wait a minute!" 

(Cid angrily turns to face him) 

Cid 
         "Shut up!! Just shut the hell up!" 

(He turns back to the mechanics. Cloud shrugs) 

Cid 
         "How's the rocket?" 

         "It's pretty much OK." 

         "But..." 

         "We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most 
important device is broken." 

Cid 
         "Broken? How's the repair goin'?" 

         "Shera's doin' it..." 

Cid 
         "Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 
100 years!" 

(He laughs) 

Cid 
         "I'm gonna take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!" 
         "Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone!" 

(They all nod) 

         "All right, Captain. Good luck." 

(They run off.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey, Cid! What're you doing!?" 

(Cid turns to him.) 

Cloud 
         "There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the 
Materia." 
         "We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from 
Sephiroth." 
         "There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You 
understand that, right?" 

(Cid shakes his head.) 

Cid 
         "Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I 
also understand what you're thinking." 
         "But listen." 
         "I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power." 

(He nods) 

Cid 
         "No. I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the 
power of science." 
         "Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to 
fly now!" 
         "And finally, we're about to go into outer space." 
         "Science is a "Power" created and developed by humans. And 
science just might be what saves this planet." 

(He raises a fist.) 

Cid 
         "I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, 
there's nothing greater!" 

(He lowers it.) 

Cid 
         "Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do!" 
         "I don't want to regret not having done something later." 

(Cloud reaches toward him.) 

Cloud 
         "But, Cid......" 

(Cid angrily pushes him away.) 

Cid 
         "Shut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!" 

(He hitches his pants up.) 

Cid 
         "Alright, time to get back to work! Anyone who ain't involved, 
get the hell outta here!" 

(The rocket engines turn on. Cid looks around, startled) 

Cid 
         "What the hell......? What the hell happened?" 

(The radio comes on. It emits a blare of static) 

Palmer 
         "Hey-hey!" 

(Cid runs over to the radio.) 

Cid 
         "Palmer! What the hell did'ya do!?" 

Palmer 
         "They said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I 
laun---ched it!" 

Cid 
         "Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!" 

(He punches some buttons on the control panel.) 

Cid 
         "DAMN! Won't even budge! It's completely locked up!" 

Palmer 
         "Hey-hey-hey! Almost lift off!" 

Cid 
         "What the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without 
it!" 

Palmer 
         "Hey!!!! Hey-hey!!! Blast------off!" 

(FMV sequence. The rocket's engines continue to steam as the timer counts 
down from 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. The engines starts spinning and burning, emitting 
a blast of air that sends trees, tires, everything that is not tied down 
blowing out of the city. The engines spin faster and faster until they 
create enough lift to send the rocket into space, leaving a trail of 
exhaust.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 123 
- Crash Course - Shinra No. 26's Huge Materia - 

(Cid and others stand in the now space-borne rocket's cockpit.) 

Cid 
         "I finally made it... outer space..." 

(He scratches his head and looks at the controls.) 

Cid 
         "Let's see, how's the course set...?"

(He punches some buttons and taps his foot as a depiction of the rocket's 
course appears on the monitor. A dotted line travels from the green circle 
of the planet to the red circle of Meteor.) 

Cid 
         "Yup, it's headed for a collision course with Meteor." 

Tifa 
         "Can't we do something? If it goes on, we're......" 

(Cid presses more buttons. A red message appears on the screen. He kicks 
the panel.) 

Cid 
         "That Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. 
We might not be able to change the course." 

Cloud 
         "...this is the end?" 

(Cid turns to him) 

Cid 
         "Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you 
give up that easily?" 

(He shakes his head) 

Cid 
         "I'm not gonna crash into Meteor." 

(He turns and presses more buttons.) 

Cid 
         "Just watch." 

(An array of red lines and messages appears. Cid turns.) 

Cid 
         "I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like 
this." 

(He goes over to a hatch on one wall and turns some dials.) 

Cid 
         "I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right 
before we crash into Meteor." 

(Tifa walks forward.) 

Tifa 
         "Hey, what about the Huge Materia?" 

Cid 
         "......" 

(He nods) 

Cid 
         "If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!" 
         "The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder." 

Cloud 
         "...You sure?" 

(Cid shakes his head.) 

Cid 
         "I dunno..." 
         "I know what I said a minute ago." 

(He turns his head upward.) 

Cid 
         "But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer 
space." 

(He looks down again.) 

Cid 
         "So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?"

(They climb the ladder to a room at the tip of the rocket. The Huge 
Materia is sitting in a glass case in the center.) 

Cloud 
         "I finally found the Huge Materia..."

(He walks to the glass case.) 

Cid 
          "It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the 
passcode from this control panel." 

(Cloud operates the panel.) 

         Enter Passcode 

Cid 
         "Hey, Cloud, you know how to use it, right?" 
         "Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those Circle, 
X, Triangle, Square buttons." 
         "If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get 
the Huge Materia!" 

(Cloud looks at him.) 

Cloud 
         "So, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in?" 

(Cid shrugs.) 

Cid 
         "I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly." 

(Cloud turns his head back to the panel. He enters a random passcode.) 

         Passcode Error 
         Unauthorized User Identified 
         Protection System will activate in 3 minutes 

Cid 
         "Seems like you missed the code!" 
         "If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection 
System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!" 

(Cloud, with some marginally helpful clues from Cid, manages to enter the 
correct passcode- Square, Circle, X, X.) 

         Passcode Confirmed 
         Identified as an Authorized User 
         Unlocked 

(The glass case opens.) 

Cid 
         "Alright, Cloud!! It's unlocked!" 

(He nods.) 

Cid 
         "Yup, my great advice saved the day." 

(Cloud gets the Huge Materia.) 








Scene 124 
- Wreckage - 

(Cloud, Huge Materia in hand, comes down the ladder, through the cockpit, 
and down to the oxygen-tank room. As he passes, one of the oxygen tanks 
sparks, then explodes. The screen goes white, then we see Shera, in some 
other room in the rocket, working on some repairs. She hears the explosion 
and rushes out. The scene fades back to the oxygen tank room. Cloud and 
Tifa are ducking and covering their heads. The tank that exploded is 
emitting dense smoke. A huge chunk of metal from it is now on the floor. 
Cid's leg is pinned under it.)

Cid 
         "Grrrgh!" 
         "Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris......" 

(Cloud and Tifa stand up.) 

Cloud 
         "Cid!!" 

(They start trying to lift the chunk of metal.) 

Tifa 
         "...I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it..." 

Cid 
         "Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the 
rocket's gonna crash into Meteor!" 

(Cloud looks up at Cid.) 

Cloud 
         "...I can't go without my friends." 

(He goes back to trying to free Cid.) 

Cid 
         "You ^%#@&%......! No time to worry 'bout other people!" 

(Cloud looks up.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm gonna do whatever I can." 

(Cid wipes his eyes with one glove.) 

Cid 
         "You're stupid. You're really $#&^%$* stupid." 

(He holds his head in one hand.) 

Cid 
         "Tank Number 8 blew up...... So Tank Number 8... really was 
malfunctioning......" 

(He leans back, looking up at the ceiling.) 

Cid 
         "Shera... You were right." 

(He covers his face again. He is close to crying.) 

Cid 
         "But, ......this is the end for me." 

(A door slides open at one end of the room.) 

Shera 
         "Don't say that, Cid." 

(Shera enters the room. Cid looks up.) 

Cid 
         "Huh!? Shera!?" 

Shera 
         "I tagged along. I'm coming to help you." 

(She helps Cloud and Tifa lift the chunk of metal.) 

Cid 
         "You stupid &$#&%*%&%#!!" 

(The others continue to struggle with the metal.) 

Cid 
         "......Sorry." 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  





  
  Scene 125 
- Escape Pod - Too Little, Too Late - 

(The scene fades in to the room where Shera had been making repairs. A 
circular portal slides open and Shera and Cloud come through it.) 

Shera 
         "The Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry." 

(They all continue to the escape pod. Shera turns to them, waiting for 
them to enter.) 

Shera 
         "Hurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod." 

(Cid hops down into the pod.)

Cid 
         "Hey, Shera! Does this Pod really fly?" 

Shera 
         "It'll be OK. I've been checking it till now." 

(Cid rubs the back of his head.) 

Cid 
         "......Then I'm relieved." 

(Shera looks down.) 

Shera 
         "......Thanks." 

                                                             
                                                             


(FMV sequence. The outer shell of the rocket tears away in one spot and 
the escape pod tumbles out. One piece of the rocket still attached falls 
away, leaving the pod, a sphere, floating back towards the planet. The 
scene fades to the interior of the pod. Cid is peering out of the viewport 
with wonder.) 

Cid 
         "So this is... outer space..." 
         "Man... it's the real thing... I'm really here in outer space..." 

(He looks back in the direction of the rocket as the blue curve of the 
planet's surface comes into view.) 

Cid 
         "So long, Shinra No. 26..." 

(FMV sequence. The escape pod hurtles back to the planet, a small flame 
forming around it as it re-enters the atmosphere. The camera switches to 
show the rocket heading straight for Meteor. It shrinks to a pinpoint as 
it plummets toward the surface of Meteor. They collide in space with a 
blinding flash of light. The scene fades to the exterior of the Shinra 
building. The light from the explosion lights the area up like fire; the 
people standing in the road all duck in fear. The scene changes to Cosmo 
Canyon, also bathed in the blinding light. The scene moves to show 
Bugenhagen, floating next to his model of the planet. The tiny replica of 
Meteor hovering above it also explodes in a light just as bright as that 
outdoors. Bugenhagen throws his arm over his eyes until the light fades. 
The scene moves back to the exterior of Shinra Building. The people slowly 
stand up as the light fades. One person frantically points at the sky. The 
camera pans up to show Meteor. FMV sequence. The camera moves along the 
surface of Meteor. Huge fragments of the rock orbit above the surface of 
Meteor, creating electrical sparks along the dry stone. Some of them crash 
into one another in huge explosions. The rocket crashed into Meteor, 
causing great damage to one side of it, but it was not enough. Meteor 
still hangs in the sky. The scene fades back to Cosmo Canyon. The entire 
village is silent and still, save the windmills which still turn 
expectantly. The scene changes back to Bugenhagen's lab. He floats next to 
the model of the planet, shaking his head sadly as the tiny Meteor still 
hovers above it. The scene changes again to the exterior of the Shinra 
building. The people in the street begin to realize what has happened. One 
young girl begins to cry; others just shake their heads; one falls to his 
knees in the street, futilely beating his fist on the asphalt in anger and 
frustration.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 126 
- The Cry Of the Planet - That Someone is Us - 

(The scene fades in. The entire party is on the bridge of the Highwind; 
Barret, Cloud and Tifa stare out the window at the clouds passing by below; 
Cid  and Cait Sith face their backs; Red XIII looks in another direction, 
distant.) 

Cloud 
         Rufus and the others plan was a failure..." 

(Cloud walks closer to the window, watching the clouds, shaking his head. 
Barret turns to him.) 

Barret 
         "What a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work." 

(Cait Sith slumps.) 

Cait Sith 
         "We been botherin' them as much as we can..." 
         "But there ain't no other way... Wonder if we've been wrong all 
this time?" 

(Red XIII turns toward the group, shaking his head.) 

Red XIII 
         "Makes you worry, doesn't it?" 

(Tifa turns to the group.) 

Tifa 
         "Don't worry! Think!" 

(Cid steps forward.) 

Cid 
         "Hey! The girl's right." 
         "You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start 
fallin' apart and get worse and worse." 

(Barret turns to him and thrusts his fist in the air half-heartedly.) 

Barret 
         "You're pretty damn optimistic! You up to somethin'?" 

(Cid walks up to him) 

Cid 
         "Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that." 
         "All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet." 
         "I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that 
escape pod." 

(Cloud turns away from the window to face the group.) 

Cloud 
         "I've been thinking too. About the universe... planet... ocean." 
         "How wide and big... No matter where I go and what I do it won't 
change a thing." 

(Cid turns to him, shaking his head.) 

Cid 
         "Maybe you're right." 

(Cloud turns back to the window.) 

Cid 
         "But I came up with something different." 

(He turns to face Cait Sith and Red XIII. Cloud, Barret, and Tifa gather 
around him.) 

Cid 
         "I always thought this planet was so huge." 
         "But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small." 

(He turns to Barret) 

Cid 
         "We're just floatin' in the dark. ......kind of makes you feel 
powerless." 
         "On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a 
sickness." 

(He turns, shaking his head.) 

Cid 
         "That's why I say this planet's still a kid." 
         "A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge 
universe." 

(He turns to Red XIII.) 

Cid 
         "Someone's gotta protect it." 

(He turns to Cloud and Tifa and cocks his head to one side, tapping his 
foot.) 

Cid 
         "Ya follow me? That someone is us." 

(Tifa steps up to him.) 

Tifa 
         "Cid... that's beautiful." 

Barret 
         "Yo! Cid! You even got to me!" 
         "So, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?" 

(Cid turns to face Cait Sith, then Red XIII, then Tifa. He scratches his 
head. He sits down on the floor, leaning against a control panel.) 

Cid 
         "..................I'm still thinkin' about that." 

(The others turn away silently and take a seat in their usual places.) 

Red XIII 
         "Huh!?" 

(He comes bounding back up the steps to the others. They all turn to face 
him.) 

Red XIII 
         "Did you...... hear something?" 

(The planet begins to cry.) 

Tifa 
         "The planet's scream...... or Meteor...? Is it this planet?" 

(They turn to face Cloud.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey, how do we know that this is really the planet's scream?" 

Tifa 
         "Did you forget?" 
         "Bugenhagen told us." 

(Cloud nods) 

Cloud 
         "Bugenhagen..." 

Red XIII 
         "Let's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!" 
         "I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful!" 








Scene 127 
- Remembrance - 

People on the Highwind 

Cait Sith 
         "This's just between you 'n' me but..." 
         "That there Bugenhagen feller, used to be a pretty handy Shinra 
worker." 
         "Yep, he ain't never bought no weapons or Mako though......" 

Barret 
         "That Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude." 
         "I though he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them 
machines." 

Tifa 
         "Did Bugenhagen...... tell you anything?" 

Cid 
         "Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me 
knowin' it?" 
         "All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me." 

Red XIII 
         "Hurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather!" 

(Cloud pilots the Highwind to Cosmo Canyon. He meets the doorman at the 
gate.) 

         "Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star..." 
         "The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside." 
         "I'd rather not see it either..." 

(Cloud heads up to Bugenhagen's observatory. Bugenhagen is waiting for 
them there.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. If you are ever in need of my wisdom, you are 
always welcome here." 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, that's why we came." 

(Bugenhagen bounces up and down) 

Bugenhagen 
         "What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each 
have to take a good long look at ourselves." 
         "There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts." 
         "Something buried, or something forgotten." 
         "Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are 
all looking for..." 

Cloud 
         "That's easy enough to say... But, I can't remember a thing." 

Bugenhagen 
         "It must be there. Look harder!" 

Tifa 
         "...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come." 

(Cloud nods and dials the PHS. The scene fades to black.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?" 

(The scene fades back in; we are at Bugenhagen's observatory, now, the 
entire party is present. Cloud and Tifa stand on either side of 
Bugenhagen; Barret stands in the back; Cait Sith stands behind Cloud, 
Red XIII is in one corner, and Cid is leaned casually against a wall, 
smoking a cigarette.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing." 

(Cloud looks down) 

Cloud 
         "I remember Aerith a lot." 
         "No... not that. You haven't remembered. You haven't forgotten. 
That's not it..." 
         "How would you say it... Aerith was right there all along. Right 
by our side." 
         "She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aerith did... The 
words she left behind..." 

Tifa 
         "That reminds me... I was the same." 

Red XIII 
         "As was I." 

Barret 
         "Me too..." 

Cloud 
         "She said that she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's 
Meteor." 

Tifa 
         "But Aerith is gone." 

Red XIII 
         "Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aerith tried to 
accomplish?" 

Barret 
         "We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean." 

(Cid turns his head toward the group) 

Cid 
         "What, did that girl go off to that place?" 

Cloud 
         "That's it!!" 

Cid 
         "What's it?" 

Cloud 
         "We don't know about it." 
         "What did Aerith know?" 
         "Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?" 

Red XIII 
         "I see... She returned there once again, correct?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there." 

Red XIII 
         "You're going too?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "What's so surprising about that...?" 
         "Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside 
world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages." 

(Red XIII turns to him) 

Red XIII 
         "It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!" 

Cid 
         "Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right." 

(Cid walks out. Bugenhagen bounces happily) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go." 

(They all leave except Cloud and Bugenhagen.) 

Cloud 
         "Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you." 
         "We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate 
stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place..." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our 
way?" 

(Cloud steps onto the elevator. Bugenhagen moves over to a switch on the 
wall.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You 
just pull this here..."

(The elevator lifts them up to the solar-system model. The Huge Materia 
is now floating in space.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...?" 
         "This is really rare Materia, indeed." 
         "Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness 
enclosed in it." 

(Cloud chooses to go back down.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave." 
         "Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever 
want to see Materia, come here anytime." 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 128 
- Knowledge Of the Ancients - 

(The scene fades in. We are in the main room of the Highwind; Bugenhagen 
is floating outisde the Operation room.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Hm, hmm, hmm!......" 
         "Smells like machinery." 
         "I love this smell." 
         "Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......" 
         "Hm? Is the deck up there?" 
         "Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time." 
         "I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind." 
         "I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in 
the smell of machinery..." 
         "Well, bye for now." 

(He floats up to the deck above.) 

People on the Highwind 

Cait Sith 
         "I went an' told Aerith's Mom about her death." 
         "Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little 
Marlene..." 

Barret 
         "And Aerith... she's dead." 
         "Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the 
planet, huh?" 
         "But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again..." 

Tifa 
         "I wonder what Aerith felt... when she was on that altar...?" 

Cloud 
         "I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet..." 

Tifa 
         "Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all." 
         "I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she 
planned on coming back all along." 
         "She always used to talk about the 'Next time'." 
         "She talked about the future more that any of us..." 

Cid 
         "Aerith...?" 
         "I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......" 

Red XIII 
         "Aerith used to pat me on the nose sometimes." 
         "I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also 
liked the attention." 
         "I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met." 

(Cloud pilots the Highwind to the City of the Ancients. He takes the same 
path he took when he first arrived on his search for Aerith, heading west, 
then north, to the small shrine in a huge cavern. The shrine is a clear 
blue, beautiful, pure, crystalline.)

Bugenhagen 
         "This is..." 

(He floats over to the shrine.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Yes...... exactly..." 

Cloud 
         "Are you getting something?" 

(He floats closer to the shrine, inspecting
it.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "...Give me a moment."

(Cloud must run around the perimeter of the cavern to reach the shrine. 
When he arrives, Bugenhagen is floating next to it.)

Bugenhagen 
         "The knowledge of the Ancients swirling around here is telling me 
one thing." 

(Cloud looks at him) 

Bugenhagen 
         "The planet's in a crisis..." 

(He shakes his head.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "A crisis beyond human power or endless time." 
         "It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'." 

Cloud 
         "Holy?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against 
Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor." 
         "If a soul seeking Holy reaches the planet, it will appear." 

(He bounces happily) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hoooo." 
         "Meteor, Weapon, everything will disappear." 

(He leans conspiratorially toward them.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Perhaps, even ourselves." 

Cloud 
         "Even us!?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "It is up to the planet to decide." 

(He floats higher, above them.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "What is best for the planet. What is bad for the planet." 
         "All that is bad will disappear. That is all." 

(He bounces) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hooo." 
         "I wonder which we humans are?" 

(Cloud looks down at the ground for a moment, then up at Bugenhagen.) 

Cloud 
         "Search for Holy... How do we do it?" 

(Bugenhagen lifts his arms up, his too-long sleeves drooping down.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Speak to the planet." 
         "Get the White Materia... This will bond the Planet to humans." 

(He nods.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Then speak to the planet." 
         "If our wish reaches the planet, the White Materia will begin to 
glow a pale green." 

(Cloud slumps.) 

Cloud 
         "...This is the end." 

(He looks up, shrugging.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith had the White Materia..." 
         "But when Aerith died, it fell from the altar..." 

(He shakes his head sadly.) 

Cloud 
         "That's why...... this is the end." 

(Bugenhagen bounces) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hooo!" 

(He bounces again as he floats back down to the party. He stops in front 
of the altar.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hooo!" 
         "Ho Ho Hooo!" 

(He moves aside.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Look at this!" 

Cloud 
         "!?" 

(The camera moves in closer to the altar. Cloud turns to look as 
Bugenhagen floats closer.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ancients' writing." 

Cloud 
         "Can you read it?" 

(He turns to face Cloud) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I can't even make it out!!" 

Cloud 
         "This's no time for jokes..." 

(He floats to the front of the altar.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I'm not an Ancient. I can't read this thing!" 

(He turns and floats lower down along the altar.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I may be old, but my eyes aren't completely bad yet. Look closely 
below the writing." 

(Cloud steps forward and looks closely.) 

Cloud 
         "There's something written in chalk... ......(even sunlight can't 
reach) ...... (Key)" 

Bugenhagen 
         "It was probably written by a scientist who's been here... He 
probably used all his energy to make out these two words." 

(Cloud looks at him) 

Cloud 
         "Key......? To what?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "I don't know... But, it probably has something to do with our 
riddle." 
         "The riddle... then it must have something to do with Aerith." 

Cloud 
         "So this note points to where the key is?"

(Bugenhagen floats higher.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Probably..." 
         "Use these words as clues and go find the key." 
         "I'll continue to figure out the Ancient's writing." 

(Cloud turns and looks up at him) 

Cloud 
         "A place (Even sunlight won't reach) is where the (key) is, 
right?" 

(Bugenhagen turns) 

Bugenhagen 
         "When you find the key, or when you can't go any further, come 
back here." 
         "Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new 
information for you." 

(Cloud nods. He sets off in search of the key.) 
  
  






   Scene 129 
- Green - Junon Cannon Relocated - 

(Cloud takes the sub by Junon in search of the key. While he's down there, 
he finds the red leader sub he sank before.) 

Cloud 
         "So this is the Leader Sub..." 
         "Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it..." 

(Cloud gets the Huge Matera from the sub.) 

         "...Huge Materia recovered..." 
         "...no damage appears to have been sustained..." 

Cloud 
         "...Phew... That's good to hear."

(Cloud continues searching until he finds the "Key" hiding in a small 
crevice.) 

Cloud 
         "Do you think it's......?" 

         "...analysis completed..." 
         "...exact date of origin cannot be determined..." 
         "...estimated to be several thousand years old..." 

Cloud 
         "Key of the Ancients..." 

(Cloud gets the Key. He returns to the City of the Ancients. He heads to 
the small shrine where Bugenhagen is waiting.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Oh! You've found it!" 
         "That Music Box over there. We'll put the key in it." 

(The camera pans over to show the stone music box as Bugenhagen floats 
over to it. It is made of many blue crystals.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "I'll go use the key. You all wait here." 
         "And watch closely what happens."

(The camera moves to show Bugenhagen as he places the Key into the music 
box. He bounces happily.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hooo!" 

(He tosses the key the rest of the way in. FMV sequence. As he does so, 
the crystals vibrate as the stone pillar in front of it recedes into the 
ground. The camera pans up; high above the shrine, a wave of water pours 
over a cliff over the cavern, creating a curtain of water around the 
shrine. Bugenhagen floats back over to Cloud, who is watching with awe.)

Bugenhagen 
         "Now, go inside. Hope may be inside... Or......" 

(Cloud enters the curtain of water. Bugenhagen floats by the shrine as 
the water pours around them.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "This was just a screen to project an image!" 
         "Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!" 

(FMV sequence. The camera floats past Cloud to show what he sees: Aerith. 
Her image is projected perfectly onto the moving pane of water, causing 
her to distort as if in a dream. We see her kneeling in prayer in the 
altar. She looks up, a smile on her face; then we see her body fall forward 
on Sephiroth's sword. We watch the materia fall from her hair as she falls, 
bouncing once on the floor, then twice. It falls with a small splash into 
the water. We now can see what happened to it after it fell. It is sitting 
peacefully at the bottom of the pool, nestled in the sand. It is glowing a 
pale green.) 

Cloud 
         "...It's glowing." 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho Hooo!! It's pale green!!" 

(Cloud touches his face.) 

Cloud 
         "...Aerith. Aerith has already prayed for Holy." 
         "...After I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...... Aerith's 
words came into my dreams..." 
         "She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... 
And to do that, there was a secret here..." 
         "That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. 
Aerith knew about here... and what she had to do." 
         "Aerith has left us great hope. But, it cost her her life... her 
future..." 
         "I'm sorry... Aerith. I should have figured this out sooner." 
         "...You left us without saying a word...... It was all so sudden, 
so I couldn't think..." 
         "That's why it took so long for me to find out... But, Aerith... 
I understand now." 
         "Aerith... I'll do the rest." 

Tifa 
         "You mean, WE..." 

(Cloud turns to Tifa.) 

Cid 
         "The big gift the flower girl left for us... It'd be sad if we 
didn't finish it!" 

(Cloud turns to Cid. He nods. He turns to face both of them and raises his 
arms.) 

Cloud 
         "Thank you... Aerith." 
         "Aerith's voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the 
glow of the White Materia." 
         "But...... how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving?" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "Why?" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Something's getting in its way." 

Cloud 
         "......Him......" 
         "He's the only one that could do it." 
         "...Sephiroth. Where are you?" 

(He leaves the shrine. On the way out of the City, the PHS rings. It's 
Cait Sith.) 

Cloud 
         "What the?" 

Cait Sith 
         "whisper... whisper... (sorry I was a little surprised)." 

Cloud 
         "What happened?" 

Cait Sith 
         "You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus 
moved it." 

Cloud 
         "Moved it? That big thing......? Where...? Why?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it." 
         "That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has 
already been used in the Rocket Plan." 
         "So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it." 
         "To a place where Materia... no, where Mako is gathered..." 

Cloud 
         "And, where is that!?" 

(FMV sequence. The camera shows Meteor hanging in the dark sky, not going 
anywhere. Then a chopper hovers up, obscuring Meteor, then a second and a 
third. They fly off, toward Midgar. The camera moves along Midgar, showing 
the framework, the fuel souces, the barrel, and finally the tip of Junon 
Cannon, appended to the top of the Shinra building. The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 130 
- Sister Ray - 

(Reeve, Heidegger and Scarlet stand around Rufus, behind his desk at 
Shinra headquarters.) 

Rufus 
         "......That's why, Reeve. It's your job to adjust the reactor's 
output." 

(Reeve looks away.) 

Reeve 
         "I see......" 

(Scarlet comes forward.) 

Scarlet 
         "Hah, hah, hah! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve." 

(She punches the air) 

Scarlet 
         "Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed!" 

Heidegger 
         "Gya hah, hah, hah! The President's sure done it this time!" 
         "If we can only defeat Sephiroth, the idea that Meteor will also 
disappear is based on different objectives!" 

(Scarlet waggles her finger at Rufus.) 

Scarlet 
         "Please remember, Mr. President..." 
         "It was my idea to fire Mako reactor powered shells." 

(Rufus flips a bit of hair off his forehead.) 

Rufus 
         "Will the shells really reach the far northern border?" 

Scarlet 
         "Ah, hah hah!" 
         "Of course!" 

(She makes a matter-of-fact gesture with her arms.) 

Scarlet 
         "But Mr. President, please do not call it a Mako cannon." 
         "This new weapon will be called......" 

(She sweeps her arm) 

Scarlet 
         "The Sister Ray!" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 131 
- Weapon Surfaces - Value Of a Life - Epic Battle - 

(Cloud hangs up the PHS and leaves the City of the Ancients. Outside, he 
prepares to board the Highwind, then stops and looks around.) 

Cloud 
         "............?" 

(The entire earth begins to vibrate in a huge earthquake.) 

Cloud 
         "Wh, what the...!?" 

(The camera moves to just above Midgar. It zooms past, flying by to the 
northern continent. Just off the coast, the water begins to ripple, then 
wave, then splash hugely. The Weapon rises from the sea. It begins to 
slowly plod toward Midgar. The scene fades to the bridge of the Highwind; 
everyone is gathered there. A red alarm light is flashing.)

Cid 
         "What's wrong?" 

(One of the pilots turns) 

         "It's a strange signal!" 

(The light flashes again) 

Cid 
         "From where?" 

(The pilot faces Cait Sith.) 

         "It's coming from this... person (?)"

(Cait Sith raises his paws in the air as the pilot turns back to the 
controls) 

Cait Sith 
         "Wow!" 

(He hops over to the rest of the group) 

Cait Sith 
         "Hey!" 

(He does a wild dance as the light continues to flash. He eventually 
stops.) 

Cait Sith 
         "That was a surprise, the controls went crazy." 
         "This ain't good..." 
         "Weapon came out of the sea and is heading straight for Midgar." 

Cloud 
         "The new weapon should stop him, right?" 

Cait Sith 
         "I don't know if it's ready or not..." 

(Barret runs forward) 

Barret 
         "Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Doncha worry none, Marlene's in a safe place. She's with 
Aerith's mama." 

(Barret scratches his forehead and turns away.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Barret!!" 

(He bounds over to Barret.) 

Cait Sith 
         "What was that scratching just now!?" 
         "As long as Marlene is safe, who cares what else happens, right?" 

(He slumps.) 

Cait Sith 
         "I been itchin' to say this to ya fer a while now!" 

(He waves his arms madly at Barret.) 

Cait Sith 
         "When ya blew the Midgar No. 1 up, how many folks d'ya think 
died?" 

Barret 
         "...that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few 
casualties." 

(Cait Sith turns away.) 

Cait Sith 
         "A few? Whaddya mean 'a few'? What may be a few to y'all is 
everything to them who died......" 

(A pause. He turns back to face Barret, who is still staring out the 
window.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Protect the planet. Hah! Y'all sure sound good!" 
         "Ain't no one that'd go against ya. So ya think ya can do 
whatever y'all want?" 

(Barret spins to face him.) 

Barret 
         "I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra..." 

(He turns back to the window. Cait Sith slumps down.) 

Cait Sith 
         "......nuthin' I can do 'bout that..." 

(Cloud turns to face them both.) 

Cloud 
         "Stop it!" 

Tifa 
         "Cait Sith...... Barret, he knows what he did." 
         "What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the 
reason." 

(She walks over to them.) 

Tifa 
         "Right? We haven't forgotten, right?" 

(She faces Cait Sith.) 

Tifa 
         "I know you." 
         "You can't quit the company because you're worried about the 
people in Midgar, right?" 

(She walks back over to Cloud.) 

Tifa 
         "......Cloud?" 

(A pause.) 

Cloud 
         "OK! Let's go! We'll beat Weapon ourselves!" 

(Cid crosses his arms.) 

Cid 
         "Hey Cloud......" 
         "You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of 
winnin', right?" 

Cloud 
         "How would I know?" 
         "But that's no reason for us to just let him go!" 
         "We're goin' to Midgar and fight Weapon! Come on, let's move!" 

(The Highwind takes off. Cloud pilots it, landing outside of Midgar. The 
Weapon continues to lumber slowly towards the city. At last it reaches the 
city; it releases a guttural roar. Cloud attacks it and the battle begins.) 

(Boss battle with Weapon) 

(FMV sequence. The Weapon turns and slowly moves back toward the sea. 
Cloud and the others stay behind; as it leaves, the huge shadow it casts 
recedes from where the party stands. They watch it go.)

Tifa 
         "What's wrong? Are you still looking for something...?" 

(Cloud shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "No, it's...... feeling something. ......Yeah, it senses murder." 

(FMV sequence. The Weapon continues its journey to the ocean.) 

Cid 
         "To my ship!" 

(They all run to the Highwind as the Weapon reaches the edge of the water. 
As Cloud turns to go, the PHS rings again. It's Cait Sith.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Oh no! Let's hurry out of here!" 
         "Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 132 
- Fire - Weapon Falls - Paths Opened - President's Redemption -

(The scene fades in to President Rufus' office. Rufus stands, looking out 
the window at the sea as Heidegger comes over the intercom.) 

Heidegger 
         "Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are 
now in order." 

(Rufus turns to face his desk as Scarlet comes on as well.) 

Scarlet 
         "Hah, hah, hah!" 
         "Anytime is fine." 

(Rufus nods and turns back to the window.) 

Rufus 
         "......Fire." 

(FMV sequence. The camera pans along the length of the Sister Ray. It looks 
ominous as it shines metallically in the night. The camera circles Midgar 
as the Mako reactors activate, one by one. When all are burning, pure Mako 
energy begins to emanate from each one through small holes in the metal 
walls. The cumulative energy of the reactors combines, flowing into the 
receptacles of the Sister Ray. The energy builds. The cannon begins to 
vibrate as a blue halo of light forms around the barrel; the molecular 
energy of the very air being drawn into the cannon as it prepares to fire. 
The halo of light is then too drawn into the barrel, and all the Mako 
energy, molecular energy, light, everything is compressed into a single 
pinpoint of light. The light from the surrounding area is as well drawn 
into the cannon and the countryside goes pitch-black. It fires. A colossal 
helix of energy launches from the cannon; the supporting structures 
collapse and every window in Shinra building shatters outwards from the 
sheer force of the fire. The scene changes to Rufus' office. He 
nonchalantly flips a lock of hair from his forehead. The scene changes 
into another FMV sequence; the Weapon, now across the ocean, turns. It 
lifts the armor plates on its body, revealing countless orifices from 
which bullets of energy begin to shoot across the ocean in the direction 
of the Sister Ray. The scene changes to the deck of the Highwind. Everyone 
is gathered there.) 

Tifa 
         "Which direction is it going to attack from?" 

Red XIII 
         "Midgar!" 

(They all run to the railing and look out at Midgar. All except Cait Sith. 
He stands facing the rudder, away from the group.) 

Barret 
         "Marlene!!" 

(FMV sequence. The Highwind circles as the fire of both the Weapon and the 
Sister Ray intermingle with each other, mixing. The white energy burst of 
the cannon strikes the Weapon square in the chest. It flies backwards as 
the entire length of the fire slips through its body. Once it is past, 
the camera moves so that we can see the inside of the Weapon's body, 
plainly shown, torn open. It sparkles with violet energy. The Weapon hits 
the ground, bounces once, then comes to a stop, dead. The scene changes 
back to the Highwind.) 

Barret 
         "Damn..." 

Red XIII 
         "It went right through Weapon........." 

(They all turn to face Cloud as he speaks.) 

Cloud 
         "I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern 
boundary!" 

(FMV sequence. The energy blast from the Sister Ray shoots along the 
northern mountains, towards the crater. The camera follows it along, 
moving to show the inside of  the blast as it speeds toward its target. It 
hits it mark. The blast slams into the energy barrier around the northern 
crater, spraying outward as if it were water from a garden hose striking a 
tree stump. The energy barrier dissipates. The scene fades in to Rufus' 
office. Rufus still stands, not moving, staring out the window. The 
operator comes on the intercom.) 

         (operator) "Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!" 
         "The barrier has disappeared!" 

(He moves for the first time and walks over to his desk. He stops and 
looks up at the ceiling as the operator speaks again.) 

         "Sir! A mass of high-density energy is heading towards Midgar!" 

(FMV sequence. The energy bullets from Weapon sail over Midgar. People 
run panicking in the streets.) 

         "Weapon's attacking!" 
         "Run for your lives!" 

(The bullets continue to sail past, striking the city in several places. 
The scene moves to show Rufus in his office. He stands motionless before 
his desk, watching calmly as the yellow bursts fly past his office. The 
camera makes a close-up on his eyes. He blinks once. Then a blast strikes 
his office. He doubles over, silhouetted against the flame for a moment, 
before his entire office is consumed. The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 133 
- Imminent Explosion - Hojo Schemes - Midgar Bound - 

(The scene fades in. Cloud and the others are on the bridge of the 
Highwind.) 

Cloud 
         "What happened to...... Sephiroth?" 

(He nods.) 

Cloud 
         "Northern Cave..." 
         "Let's go see what happened to it." 

(Cloud pilots the Highwind over the Northern Continent. He looks out at 
the Northern Crater.) 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone......" 

(He turns to Cid, who stands near the pilot in training.) 

Cloud 
         "Cid! Can the airship get inside?" 

Cid 
         "Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!" 

Cloud 
         "Right, sorry about that." 

(Barret turns to Cait Sith.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?" 

(He jumps) 

Cait Sith 
         "Hold it!" 

(He hops a few steps away.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?"

(The scene fades in to the board room in the Shinra building. Heidegger 
has a phone pressed to his ear. Reeve and Scarlet look on. After a moment, 
he puts the phone down.) 

Heidegger 
         "Strange. I can't reach the President." 

Reeve 
         "Not the President. To Sister Ray!"

Scarlet 
         "Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely." 

(Reeve shakes his head.) 

Reeve 
         "None of that matters!" 
         "The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!" 

Scarlet 
         "Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise!" 
         "It must be cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off 
the machine!" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Reeve 
         "We can't do that! It's inoperable!" 

(He pulls out a portable phone and holds it up to his ear.) 

         "Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation!" 
         "We can't operate it from here." 

Reeve 
         "What about the mainframe? Who!?" 

(He turns to Heidegger.) 

Reeve 
         "Hey, call the mainframe!" 

(Heidegger picks up the phone for a moment, then puts it down and looks at 
Reeve.) 

Heidegger 
         "Huh? Why are you giving orders?" 

Reeve 
         "I don't give a damn about the details!!" 

(He turns away and listens into his phone again. The scene fades to a 
small lab at the top of Shinra building. It is exposed to the open air; 
electric sparks jump along the metal walkway. Hojo is pressing buttons at 
a large control panel.)

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth." 
         "I'll give you all the Mako you want." 

(The intercom comes on; Reeve called it from his portable phone.) 

Reeve 
         "Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!" 

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...It's a small price to 
pay." 

Reeve 
         "Hojo! HOJO......!!" 

(Hojo doesn't answer. He continues to press buttons and pull levers for a 
few more moments.) 

Hojo 
         "Show me...... Sephiroth." 
         "It should be near..." 
         "Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science..." 
         "Before your presence, science is powerless..." 
         "I hate it, but I'll concede to it." 
         "Just... let me see it." 
         "Ha, ha, ha......" 

(The scene fades back to the bridge of the Highwind. Barret shakes his 
arms at Cait Sith) 

Barret 
         "YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!" 

(Cait Sith slumps and tiptoes timidly up to Barret.) 

Cait Sith 
         "We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own......" 
         "...? ...? H, huh!?" 

(He turns) 

Cait Sith 
         "I don't like this......" 

(Barret steps up to him.) 

Barret 
         "You're busted, Reeve!" 

(Cait Sith waves his arms madly) 

Barret 
         "Too late tryin' to hide it now..." 

Cloud 
         "Can't you stop the Mako reactor?" 

(Red XIII and Tifa gather around.) 

Cait Sith 
         "......We can't stop it." 

Barret 
         "You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?" 

Cait Sith 
         "............" 

Cid 
         "We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us 
now!" 

Cait Sith 
         "I can't make you trust me......" 

Cid 
         "You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?" 
         "I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if 
you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?" 

Cait Sith 
         "No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!" 

Cid 
         "Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves......" 
         "But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below." 
         "Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until 
everything blasts out..." 
         "And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out........" 

Barret 
         "An explosion!!" 

Cait Sith 
         "This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor 
blew up!" 

(Barret turns away) 

Barret 
         "Damn...!" 

Cait Sith 
         "Forget about that......... the CANNON! We've got to get to 
Midgar! That's the first thing!!" 

Cloud 
         "Must stop Hojo... first." 

(The scene fades back to the Shinra board room. Reeve, Heidegger, and 
Scarlet stand at the end of the long table. Reeve turns to Heidegger.) 

Reeve 
         "Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the 
way!" 

(Heidegger laughs.) 

Heidegger 
         "Ghaa haah hah hah!" 
         "Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders!" 
         "The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the 
enemy retreat!" 

(Scarlet laughs) 

Heidegger 
         "Because of them, I...... I..!" 

Reeve 
         "That's a private matter......" 

Heidegger 
         "The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!" 
         "Ghaa haah hah hah!" 

Scarlet 
         "Ha, ha, ha." 
         "Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!" 

(Two guards come in and surround Reeve. Scarlet and Heidegger laugh and 
exit.) 

Reeve 
         "Hey! Wait!!" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Reeve 
         "Cloud, everybody! Sorry......" 
         "But!!" 

(The scene fades back to the Highwind bridge.) 

Cait Sith 
         "But!" 
         "But you'll come, won't you!?" 

(Cloud walks to him.) 

Cloud 
         "I know!" 

(They all nod.) 

Cid 
         "Hey!" 

(He turns to the pilot in training.) 

Cid 
         "I'm leaving the ship in your hands!" 

(He nods.) 

         "I'm heading for Midgar!" 








Scene 134
- Parachute Into Midgar - Turk Settlement - The Proud Clod - Hojo 
Transforms -

(Cloud pilots the Highwind to enter Midgar airspace. The scene shifts to 
the bridge of the Highwind. A crewman salutes and clicks his heels.) 

         "We've reached Midgar!" 

Barret 
         "Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!" 
         "There'll be no way we could slip into the slums." 

Tifa 
         "Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......" 

Cid 
         "Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?" 
         "Where are we now!?"

Barret 
         "Huh? Where are we...?" 

Cid 
         "If land's no go... We'll go by air!" 

Cloud 
         "Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!" 

(All exit the bridge. Crewmen salute as they run past, single file, onto 
the outer deck. Cloud steps to the railing.) 

Cloud 
         "Here we go!!" 

(They all leap over the railing. FMV sequence. As the Highwind flies 
overhead, the party plummets past. The camera follows as they fall high 
above Midgar, finally opening their chutes just above the city streets. 
Cloud lands softly near an alley. Cait Sith comes bounding up.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Heidegger is going after you all." 
         "That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!"

(He runs off into the alley. Cloud follows to find the rest of the party 
waiting there.)

Barret 
         "Sounds strange comin' from me..."

         "But it feels like home bein' back in
Midgar." 
         "Kinda makes me sick..." 

Red XIII 
         "I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!" 

(Cait Sith is dancing with excitement next to a storm door at the end of 
the alley. Cloud speaks to him and the music fades.) 

Cait Sith 
         "This is where we go in." 

(He throws the door open.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Please! Hurry and come to the Mako Cannon!" 

(He leaps down the storm door. Cloud follows. Beneath the storm door is a 
vast maze of pipes, walkways, and ladders. Traversing the mechanical rooms, 
Cloud arrives in the subway beneath Midgar. He begins to head through it 
when he hears a voice behind him.) 

         "Oh no! They're here!" 

(Elena comes running up to them.) 

Elena 
         "What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore 
your orders now." 

(Reno walks up behind her from offscreen.) 

Reno 
         "...Elena, don't act so weak." 

(Rude enters.) 

Rude 
         "We're Turks, Elena." 

(She shakes her head.) 

Elena 
         "...Yes, sir. You're right." 

Rude 
         "Come on, we've got work to do." 

Reno 
         "I'm not really up for it, but..." 

Elena 
         "Our orders were to seek you out and..." 
         "...Kill." 
         "Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order." 
         "That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!" 

(Reno and Rude scratch their heads.) 

Cloud 
         "......" 

Elena 
         "What are you doing! Let's go!" 

<CHOICE> 
         Okay, let's end this 
         No, let's not go 

***Cloud 
         Okay, let's end this 

(The party assumes a fighting stance.) 

Reno 
         "I know we've got a weird relationship, but..." 
         "We have to end this... like Turks!" 

(Battle sequence with Reno, Rude, and Elena.) 

***Cloud 
         No, let's not go 

(Elena jumps) 

Elena 
         "You're showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!" 

Reno 
         "Wait, Elena." 

(She spins to face him.) 

Elena 
         "Reno! You're not violating the order... are you!?" 

Reno 
         "Shinra's finished. It's come down to this." 

Rude 
         "......" 

(She looks at Rude, then back to Reno) 

Elena 
         "Rude..." 

(She turns her head away from both of them.) 

Reno 
         "Elena, you were a great Turk!" 

(A pause.) 

Elena 
         "......" 

(Reno waves to the party.) 

Reno 
         "Farewell. If we both survive..." 
         "If we can save our lives..." 

(He turns and walks away. Elena turns to the party.) 

Elena 
         "Remember the spirit of the Turks...!" 

(She waves and runs off.) 

Rude 
         "Our mission's finished..." 

(He turns and leaves. The party continues on. A bit further down the 
subway, they reach an exit that takes them to an exterior street of 
Midgar. They climb a tower marked '59' to reach an upper road and are 
about to continue when they hear huge robotic footsteps behind them, 
getting closer and closer.)

Tifa 
         "This can't be..." 

(A huge mech arrives behind them and comes to a stop.) 

Cid 
         "Hey-hey! You serious...?" 

(A door in the front of the robot swings open. The robot lifts a huge 
hand to the opening.) 

         "G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!" 

(Heidegger steps out onto the hand.) 

         "G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!" 

(Scarlet exits the robot and stands next to Heidegger. The robot swings 
its hand outwards, holding them both.) 

Heidegger 
         "You sure did treat us like dogs up to now!!" 

Scarlet 
         "You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers!" 

(Heidegger starts to cackle vigorously.) 

Heidegger 
         "G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against 
anti-Weapon artillery!" 

Scarlet 
         "You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing!" 

(She gestures and the robot deposits the two of them back inside. The 
door swings closed as it swings a massive fist down to punch the ground 
near the party.) 

Scarlet 
         "I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!" 

(Boss battle with Proud Clod) 

(The Proud Clod freezes. It begins to make electrical sparking sounds) 

Scarlet 
         "Not that! This is the Proud Clod............!?" 

(It begins to glow white and makes thundering sounds. It falls to its 
knees.) 

Heidegger 
         "Whoooooooa!!" 

(The screen goes white as it explodes. It begins to rain. The party 
continues. They head north along the street, reaching a set of wooden 
stairs. Cait Sith is waiting at the top.) 

Cait Sith 
         "This way, Cloud!" 

(He bounds up the stairs and motions for them to follow. They do so. They 
continue to climb the stairs, ascending a huge metal tower. At the top 
is a large instrument panel. Hojo is feverishly pressing buttons and 
flipping switches.) 

Cloud 
         "Hojo! Stop right there!!" 

(Hojo does not turn to face them. He merely continues his work.) 

Hojo 
         "Oh... the failure." 

Cloud 
         "At least remember my name! It's Cloud!" 

(Hojo stops working but still does not turn) 

Hojo 
         "Every time I see you, I..." 
         "It pains me that I had so little scientific sense..." 

(He resumes.) 

Hojo 
         "I evaluated you as a failed project." 
         "But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone." 
         "Heh, heh, heh......... I'm even beginning to hate myself." 

Cloud 
         "None of that matters... just stop this nonsense!" 

Hojo 
         "...nonsense?" 
         "Oh, this?" 

(He finally turns to look at Cloud.) 

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha..." 
         "Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy." 
         "So I'm going to lend him a hand." 

Cloud 
         "Why!? Why do that!?" 

Hojo 
         "Quit asking me why, you moron." 

(He walks up to look Cloud in the eye.) 

Hojo 
         "Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist." 

(He turns back to the panel.) 

Hojo 
         "Energy level is at...... 83%. It's taking too long." 

(He resumes his button-pressing.) 

Hojo 
         "My son is in need of power and help. ...That's the only reason." 

Cloud 
         "...your son?" 

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know." 

(He begins to laugh so hard he has to stop working.) 

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...!!" 
         "What will Sephiroth think when he finds out that I'm his father?" 
         "Always looking down on me like that." 
         "HA, HA, HA...!!" 

Cloud 
         "Sephiroth is your son!?" 

(Hojo resumes his work once more.) 

Hojo 
         "Ha, ha, ha..." 
         "I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova 
Project." 
         "When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of 
Jenova..." 
         "HA, HA, HA!!" 

Cloud 
         "I can't believe you're the one who did this..." 
         "The illusionary crime against Sephiroth..." 

(Hojo stops and calmly turns to face Cloud. They stare at each other for a 
long moment, then Hojo begins to laugh.) 

Hojo 
         "Heee, hee, hee, hee! No, you're wrong!" 
         "It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!" 

(He stops abruptly) 

Hojo 
         "I... was defeated by my desire to
become a scientist." 
         "I lost the last time as well." 

(He begins to gleefully dance about.) 

Hojo 
         "I've injected Jenova's cells into my
own body!" 
         "Heee, hee, hee!" 
         "Here are......" 
         "Heee, hee, hee!" 
         "...my results!!" 

(Boss battle with Hojo. He undergoes three transformations during the 
battle, each more deformed than the last, as Jenova's cells take effect.) 

Cloud 
         "......" 

(Cid sighs.) 

Cid 
         "%$#&$*&^%^" 

Tifa 
         "I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son..." 

(The sound of the wind and rain continues as the scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 135
- Seven Days - We Have A Reason To Fight -

(The scene fades in. The party is gathered on the bridge of the Highwind.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Shinra's...... finished." 

(Cloud walks toward the huge bay window.) 

Cloud 
         "Meteor's gonna fall in about......" 

(He turns to face the others. Red XIII shakes his head.) 

Red XIII 
         "Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said." 

(Cloud comes to him.) 

Cloud 
         "Red XIII........." 
         "You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again?" 

(Red XIII turns away) 

Red XIII 
         ".........yes." 

(He turns back to him. Cloud turns to Barret, who is gazing out at the 
clouds below.) 

Cloud 
         "You want to see Marlene, right?" 

(Barret turns) 

Barret 
         "Don't ask me that." 

(Cloud shakes his head) 

Cloud 
         "We'll beat Sephiroth..." 
         "Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven 
days........." 
         "There won't be a planet left to protect." 

(He shrugs) 

Cloud 
         "If we can't beat Sephiroth..." 
         "It's as good as death for us." 
         "We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from 
Meteor." 

Barret 
         "Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight!" 

Cloud 
         "No!" 

(He walks up to the bay window.) 

Cloud 
         "What I meant was..." 

(He turns to the others) 

Cloud 
         "What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that." 
         "Save the planet... for the future of the planet... Sure, that's 
all fine." 
         "But really, is that really how it is?" 

(He takes a few steps forward) 

Cloud 
         "For me, this is a personal feud." 
         "I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past." 
         "Saving the planet just happens to be a part of that." 
         "I've been thinking." 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "I think we all are fighting for ourselves." 
         "For ourselves... and that someone... something... whatever it 
is, that's important to us." 
         "That's what we're fighting for." 
         "That's why we keep up this battle for the planet." 

(He looks at Barret. Barret scratches his head) 

Barret 
         "You're right..." 
         "It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet." 
         "But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor......" 
         "Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to 
do things." 
         "I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer..." 

(He thrusts his fist into the air) 

Barret 
         "...At first, it was for revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my 
town." 
         "But now......" 
         "Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene." 
         "For Marlene... For Marlene's future..." 
         "Yeah... I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake..." 

(Cloud nods) 

Cloud 
         "Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back." 

(He turns to the others) 

Cloud 
         "All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for 
yourselves." 
         "I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back." 

Cid 
         "Maybe ain't none of us'll come back." 
         "Meteor's just gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any 
useless struggling!" 

(Cloud nods) 

Cloud 
         "I know why I'm fighting." 
         "I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that." 
         "But besides that, there's something personal too..." 
         "A very personal memory that I have." 
         "What about you all?" 
         "I want all of you to find that something within yourselves." 
         "If you don't find it, then that's okay too." 
         "You can't fight without a reason, right?" 
         "So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back." 

(He nods. Cid rubs the back of his head and turns to the pilot. The scene 
fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 136
- Understanding -

(The scene fades in to show Cloud and Tifa alone on the bridge. Tifa is 
still watching the clouds go by.) 

Cloud 
         "What are you going to do, Tifa?" 

(She turns to him) 

Tifa 
         "Did you forget?" 
         "I'm... all alone. I don't have anywhere to go." 

(The scene fades out, then in to show Cloud and Tifa on a grassy hill. 
Tifa stands close to the camera, looking past the player. Cloud is behind 
her, staring in another direction. The Highwind hovers above. The only 
sound is that of the wind.) 

Tifa 
         "Everyone's gone..." 

Cloud 
         "Yeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to." 

(She looks down.) 

Tifa 
         "You're right..." 

(A pause. She looks up and straightens her hair with one hand.) 

Tifa 
         "But... I'm sure someday... they'll come back, don't you think?" 

(He crosses his arms) 

Cloud 
         "Hmm... I wonder...?" 
         "Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to..." 
         "But this time, our opponent..." 

(A long pause. The sound of the wind fades. Tifa nods) 

Tifa 
         "Hmm... But that's all right, even if no one comes back." 
         "As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I 
won't give up even if I'm scared." 

(He uncrosses his arms and looks at Tifa.) 

Cloud 
         "...... Tifa......" 

(She moves her arms behind her.) 

Tifa 
         "No matter how close we are... We were far apart... before this." 
         "But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those 
screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice..." 

(She closes her eyes, crying softly. Her arms fall to her sides and she 
bows her head.) 

Tifa 
         "...sniff... you probably don't remember this..." 
         "But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name... Or at least 
I thought I did..." 

(Cloud looks away and puts a hand to his face) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah... At that time I heard you calling me." 
         "You were calling me back in from the stream of consciousness in 
the Lifestream." 

(He lowers his hand. He nods) 

Cloud 
         "After all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to 
you, I would come to help." 

(Tifa opens her eyes and looks up.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?" 

(She gazes off to one side) 

Tifa 
         "Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?" 

(Cloud looks up at the sky.) 

Cloud 
         "I dunno... But..." 
         "Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And 
believe in ourselves..." 
         "Someday we'll find the answer. Right, Tifa?" 
         "That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream." 

(She nods) 

Tifa 
         "Yeah...... that's right..." 

(Cloud stares off into the distance. He turns away from her slightly and 
lowers his head.) 

Cloud 
         "Hey, Tifa...... I...... There are a lot of things I wanted to 
talk to you about." 

(He shakes his head slowly.) 

Cloud 
         "But now that we're together like this, I don't know what I 
really wanted to say..." 
         "I guess nothing's changed at all... Kind of makes you want to 
laugh..." 

(Tifa shakes her head) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... Words aren't the only thing that tell people what 
you're thinking..." 

(Cloud looks at her. She continues to stare past the player, into space. 
She straightens her hair again with one hand.) 

Cloud 
         "............" 

(She closes her eyes. The camera pans up, past her, to the sky, as the 
scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 137
- Last Morning -

(The scene fades in once more to the grassy hill. It is still mostly dark 
out, but the hint of a sun is glowing beyond the horizon. Cloud and Tifa 
are seated on a small rise in the ground. Tifa is resting her head on his 
shoulder; both are dozing. Cloud lifts his head slightly.) 

Cloud 
         "............It's almost dawn..." 

Tifa 
         "H, huh...?" 

(He lifts his head further, just enough so that he can look at her.) 

Cloud 
         "Sorry. Did I wake you...? It's almost dawn, Tifa." 

(She lifts her head off his shoulder and looks around sleepily.) 

Tifa 
         "Umm... G, good morning... Cloud." 
         "Give me a little longer... Just a little bit longer..." 

(She rests his head on his shoulder again.) 

Tifa 
         "This day will never come again... So let me have this moment..." 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "Yeah... okay." 

(He lowers his head again.) 

Cloud 
         "This is probably the last time we'll have together......" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 138
- We Shall Fight Together -

(The scene fades in to show the Highwind hovering in the bright morning 
sky. The camera pans back down to the hill. Cloud is still sitting down; 
Tifa has risen and is gazing up at the Highwind, her hands behind her back. 
After a few moments, she drops her hands and shakes her head.) 

Tifa 
         "............" 

(Cloud stands.) 

Cloud 
         "We'd better go." 

(She turns to him and makes a pleading gesture.) 

Tifa 
         "But, I still...!?" 

(He turns to face her, shaking his head.) 

Cloud 
         "It's all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday." 
         "At least we don't have to go on alone." 

(A pause. Tifa nods) 

Tifa 
         "Yes... That's right!" 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "Okay! Let's go!" 

(They walk together toward the Highwind. It begins to lower to the ground 
as the scene fades. It fades back in to show the walkway to the bridge. 
Tifa is following Cloud there.) 

Tifa 
         "The airship is too big for just the two of us." 
         "Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone." 

(Cloud turns around to face her.) 

Cloud 
         "Don't worry. It'll be okay." 

(He does his squat-thrusts.) 

Cloud 
         "I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone." 

(He stops and straightens his hair.) 

Cloud 
         "Besides, I'm the pilot." 
         "No more flying around casually like before." 
         "We won't have time to feel lonely." 

(She nods. A long pause. Suddenly, the entire Highwind shakes as the 
engines fire up.) 

Tifa 
         "Huh!?" 

(She looks around.) 

Cloud 
         "It's moving......"

(They dash to the bridge. They find Cait Sith dozing in one corner. They 
run past him and find Barret and Cid working with the pilot's controls.) 

Cloud 
         "Barret! Cid!" 

(Barret turns and looks at Cloud, then at Tifa, then back to Cloud) 

Barret 
         "O, oh...... is that okay with you?" 

(Red XIII runs up to them from offscreen.) 

Cloud 
         "Red XIII!" 

(Cloud and Tifa look back to Barret.) 

Tifa 
         "Why didn't you tell me!?" 

(Red XIII looks at Cid, who still is operating the controls.) 

Red XIII 
         "But, you know, Cid." 

(He looks at Cloud. Cid leaves the controls and stares at Red XIII.) 

Cid 
         "Hey, Red XIII." 
         "If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later......" 

Tifa 
         "......Were you watching?" 

(They watch her as she runs away, clutches her head and falls to the floor 
in embarrassment. Vincent enters the bridge. All except Tifa turn to see 
him enter.) 

Cloud 
         "Vincent!" 

(Tifa stands up and turns to look at Vincent. Vincent turns away.) 

Vincent 
         "Why the puzzled look?" 
         "Don't you want me to come?" 

(Cloud turns his head away.) 

Cloud 
         "No, it's just that you're always so cold. I thought you didn't 
care what was happening." 

(He looks up. Vincent spins, his cape flying, to face Cloud.) 

Vincent 
         "Cool?" 
         "Hmmm...... I guess that's just how I am, sorry." 

(He does a spectacular backflip and lands on a platform in a corner. The 
room flashes red and the sound of static blares as Cait Sith's radio 
control comes back on line as he wakes.) 

Barret 
         "Well lookey-here. The Shinra manager's come back." 

(Cait Sith stands up and bounds over to the rest of the group. He bows 
deeply.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Uh, excuse me but..." 
         "I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get 
away......" 
         "So some people in Midgar took me in." 

(He straightens) 

Cait Sith 
         "I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard!" 

(Cait Sith hops to his usual place near a secondary control panel.) 

Barret 
         "I guess that's everyone." 

(Red XIII shakes his head) 

Red XIII 
         "No, Yuffie's missing." 

Barret 
         "She ain't gonna show up." 
         "'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta 
be thankful for that."

(Yuffie suddenly drops down from the ceiling, lands in the middle of the 
group, and shadowboxes energetically.) 

Yuffie 
         "How could you say that!?" 

(She looks at Barret) 

Yuffie 
         "I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog!" 

(She shadowboxes a bit more.) 


Yuffie 
         "I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the 
best parts all to yourselves!" 

(Cloud turns to face her and nods) 

Cloud 
         "Welcome back, Yuffie." 

Yuffie 
         "Gee, Cloud...... that's so nice of you to say that. ......You 
sick?" 

(She launches back up to the ceiling.) 

Yuffie 
         "Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the 
hall...... waiting...... upp! ......Urk!" 

(She drops back down and heads off to the walkway. Cloud goes to stand 
near the head of the bridge and bows his head deeply.) 

Cloud 
         "Thanks everyone." 

(Barret turns to face him. Cloud looks up.) 

Barret 
         "We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass!" 
         "We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my...... whatcha call, 
feelings or somethin'." 
         "I, uh, I ain't got no words now......" 

(Aerith's Theme begins to play in the background.) 

Red XIII 
         "......Although she's not here, she left us a window of 
opportunity..."

(He looks at Cid. Cid turns to Cloud and nods.) 

Cid 
         "We can't let it go like this." 

(Cloud turns away and stares out the window.) 

Cloud 
         "......Aerith." 
         "She was smiling to the end." 
         "We have to do something, or that smile will just freeze like 
that." 

(He turns to the others. He nods.) 

Cloud 
         "Let's all go together." 
         "Memories of Aerith......" 
         "Although she should've returned to the planet by now, something 
stopped her and now she's stuck......" 
         "We've got to let go of Aerith's memory." 

(Cid looks around at the others.) 

Cid 
         "Has anyone here changed their mind?" 

(Cloud nods to him.) 

Cloud 
         "I'm counting on you, Cid." 

Cid 
         "Yeah, yeah......" 
         "There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while 
now..." 

(He runs over to the instrument panel.) 

Cid 
         "Let me try them out." 

(The music fades.) 

Cid 
         "All right, so what should I do?" 
         "You decide, Cloud." 

(Cloud stands tall at the head of the bridge. The others all turn to look 
at him.) 

Cloud 
         "This is our last battle." 
         "Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is...... Sephiroth!" 

(He steps forward.) 

Cloud 
         "So let's move out!" 

(Cid flips the levers. FMV sequence. Panels strip away from the exterior 
of the Highwind and various extensions emerge such as extra rudders and 
jet-propulsion engines. The Highwind speeds away over the horizon. The 
scene returns to the bridge.)

Cloud 
         "We're almost to the North Cave!
We're on our way, Sephiroth!" 

Cid 
         "Man, I'm going to stick it to him!" 

(A red warning light begins to flash and an alarm begins to sound. The 
others rush over to the instrument panel.) 

Cloud 
         "What is it, Cid?" 

Cid 
         "Errrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing... control......!" 

(The three-man Highwind crew comes dashing in from offscreen and begins to 
assist Cid.)

Cid 
         "Get the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go 
home!?" 

         "Yes, sir. This is our home!!" 

Cid 
         "Oh ma-- ......stop trying to act so cool." 
         "All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!" 
         "Geronimo!!" 

(He pushes the Highwind to the red-line; the screen goes white with energy 
as the Highwind speeds off. The scene fades to black.) 
  
  

END OF DISC 2 



Scene 139
- The North Crater -

(The scene fades in to show the mural of a bikini-clad woman painted on 
the side of the Highwind. The camera pans down to show the rest of the 
ship; it is docked just outside the North Crater. A crewman marches to the 
railing and unrolls a rope ladder over the side, offering passage down 
into Sephiroth's lair.) 

People on the Highwind 

Yuffie 
         "Huh?" 
         "How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is... 
getting sick on boats and rides......" 
         "So, please...... just leave me alone." 

Cloud 
         "......I really do understand, Yuffie. When I get sick on a 
flight, it's a real killer." 
         "When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion 
sickness." 

Yuffie 
         "Oh......" 
         "Isn't there any way to prevent this?" 

Cloud 
         "Well, according to my research......" 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick." 
         "But you can't always be nervous." 

(He does his squat-thrusts) 

Cloud 
         "With this much space, your best bet is to move around while 
you're riding." 
         "It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too." 
         "But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks." 
         "That sucked!......" 

(He clutches his head as he remembers) 

Cloud 
         "And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding." 
         "And that is......" 

(He nods) 

Cloud 
         "Read!" 
         "Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do." 
         "I know it's tough......" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Yuffie 
         "......so you're a little better off than me." 
         "But I don't feel...... well." 

(She goes back to her position of clutching her stomach near the walkway.) 

Yuffie 
         "Cloud...... sign this." 

Cloud 
         "What is it?" 

Yuffie 
         "It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia 
will belong to me." 
         "It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all 
right?" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "Forget it, Yuffie. I'm not even gonna read it." 
         "Whenever I read, I get airsick." 

Yuffie 
         "Oh yeah......?" 
         "I'm the same way, so I can't say too much......" 
         "Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on Red XIII later to let off 
steam." 

Cait Sith 
         "But I ain't gonna forget, no matter what happens." 
         "Not about this here trip, or them folks-- none of it!" 

Red XIII 
         "I am Nanaki, son of Seto... I am afraid of nothing..." 
         "It's all right, all right. I'm Nanaki, the son of brave Seto... 
I'm not afraid of Sephiroth..." 

Vincent 
         "Cloud...... take the ship to the Northern Cave." 
         "The time for flying is now past." 
         "Our battlefield is now beneath the earth..." 
         "The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the 
darkness of the depths of the earth........" 

Barret 
         "Heh heh...... heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on 
ya, huh?" 
         "I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh... I feel sick..." 

Tifa 
         "Hey, Cloud... Would you tell me 'It's all right'?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Say it cool 
         Say it normal 
         Don't say it 

***Cloud 
         Say it cool 

(He straightens his hair and strikes a pose.) 

Cloud 
         "It's all right, Tifa." 

(He nods. Tifa claps her hands happily.) 

Tifa 
         "Now I feel like things are really going to be all right." 
         "Thanks, Cloud." 

***Cloud 
         Say it normal 

(He nods.) 

Cloud 
         "...It's all right." 

Tifa 
         "You're right, things will be all right." 

***Cloud 
         Don't say it 

(He shakes his head slightly.) 

Cloud 
         "...I just can't say it that easy." 

(Tifa shakes her head sadly.) 

Tifa 
         "I'm sorry... I guess you're right." 
<//> 

Cid 
         "You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?" 

<CHOICE> 
         No 
         Yes 

***Cloud 
         No 

Cid 
         "Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays." 

***Cloud 
         Yes 

Cid 
         "Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine." 
         "They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid." 
         "An' I remember seein' it just once..." 
         "That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot." 
         "I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play." 
         "Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything." 
         "But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would." 
         "Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up 
tellin' me my snorin' was too loud." 
         "So about all I really remember of that play is the end..." 
         "The sister of the lead asks her lover," 

(He gestures dramatically) 

Cid 
         "Do you really have to leave?" 

(He shakes his head) 

Cid 
         "And the guy says," 

(He gestures again) 

Cid 
         "I promised. The people I love are waiting." 

(He shakes his head) 

Cid 
         "......I don't understand. Not at all. But...... please take care 
of yourself." 

(He nods) 

Cid 
         "Of course... I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to 
wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here." 

(He turns away and taps his foot.) 

Cid 
         "I remember thinking when I heard those lines," 
         "*&%! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know... now I'm 
not so sure..." 
         "I think I understand......" 

(Cloud climbs down the rope ladder and into the North Crater. A ways away 
from the Highwind, he reaches a steep dropoff down into the depths of the 
cave.) 

Cloud 
         "Looks like we can only slide down." 

<CHOICE> 
         Alright, let's go! 
         We'll get prepared first 

***Cloud 
         Alright, let's go! 

(He slides down into the crater.) 

***Cloud 
         We'll get prepared first 

(He returns to the Highwind.) 

<//> 

(Cloud descends into the crater. Sections of the wall fall away inches 
from his feet as he continues toward the eerie green glow at the bottom. 
Traversing a long, complex series of platforms and tunnels, he reaches a 
large cavern where the path splits two ways. The rest of the party is 
waiting there.)

Cloud 
         "The road splits in two. We'll split into two groups." 

(Cloud next chooses whether each party member will go left or right.) 

Cid 
         "Which you gonna choose, Cloud?" 

Barret 
         "All right. Then I'll go..." 

Tifa 
         "Then I'm going..." 

Red XIII 
         "All right, then I'll go..." 

Yuffie 
         "I'm going......" 

Cait Sith 
         "Then I'll be heading..." 

Vincent 
         "Then, I will be going......" 

Cid 
         "All right! I'm headin'..." 

(Cloud looks around at all the others.) 

Cloud 
         "Now don't any of you die on me. ......" 
         "Gotta get through to Sephiroth!" 

Vincent 
         "It's all over now. With this..." 

Yuffie 
         "Oh man... 'Materia Hunter Yuffie' sounds like the last chapter 
of 'Materia Forever.'" 

Red XIII 
         "All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is 
in our hands..." 

Cait Sith 
         "I'm so happy to have met you all, really! ...sniff..." 

Barret 
         "Well...... Looks like this is our last big job!" 

(The others go their separate ways.) 

Cloud 
         "This will be the end of it!" 

(Whichever party you choose will continue along their chosen path, perhaps 
a series of platforms, a deep cave, or swamp, until they reach another 
crater deep inside. Golden mist wafts upward from a green glow at the 
bottom. A series of suspended stone platforms form a path down to the 
bottom. The party approaches them.) 

Barret 
         "Yo, we're a bit late?" 

(Barret appears from another of the possible paths. He leaps down to join 
the others. The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 140
- The Planet's Core - Jenova-SYNTHESIS -

(Cloud and the entire party are gathered at the lip of the final crater in 
the North Cave. Cloud stares down into the bright glow.) 

Cloud 
         "This is the center of the Planet...?"

(He speaks to each of the other party members.) 

Cid 
         "Let's just get this over with!" 

Tifa 
         "This is it." 

Barret 
         "Here, Cloud." 

(He hands Cloud a Guard Source.) 

Red XIII 
         "Cloud, I found this..." 

(He gives Cloud a Mind Source.) 

Cait Sith 
         "Hey Cloud, I found this." 

(He gives Cloud an Elixir.) 

Vincent 
         "Hold on to this." 

(He gives Cloud a Last Elixir.) 

Yuffie 
         ".........Wh... what?" 

Barret 
         "Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?" 

(She shakes her head.) 

Yuffie 
         "Oh, all right." 
         "Here, Cloud." 

(She gives Cloud a Last Elixir.) 

Yuffie 
         "But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me 
when you're done with it!" 

Barret 
         "Awright, this's the last dance!" 

Red XIII 
         "We finally made it here." 

Cait Sith 
         "Well, shall we get goin'?" 

Vincent 
         "Hmm... Being with you all is not so bad." 

(Cloud prepares to follow the path of stone platforms down into the 
crater.) 

Cloud 
         "All right, everyone, let's mosey." 

Cid 
         "Damn! Again!" 
         "Stop sayin' it like a wimp!" 
         "Can't you say 'Move out!' or somethin'?" 

(Cloud rubs the back of his head, then vehemently gestures with his fist.) 

Cloud 
         "Move out!!" 

(The sound of roaring monsters comes from above.) 

Barret 
         "What?" 

(The party looks skyward) 

Red XIII 
         "Look at the number..." 

(They assume fighting stances.) 

Cid 
         "%#@^! They're comin' out in force!" 

Barret 
         "Cloud! You go first!" 

(Cloud shakes his head quickly) 

Cloud 
         "I'm fighting here too." 

Barret 
         "Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!" 

Cid 
         "Barret's right." 
         "You take two of us with you and go first. The rest'll catch up 
with ya later." 

Tifa 
         "Is this like a practice run before the real thing?" 

Cait Sith 
         "Yeah, a major practice run..." 

(Yuffie does a little fighting-dance.) 

Yuffie 
         "Heh heh, I'm fine with that." (It's probably more fun than 
fighting Sephiroth down there." 

Vincent 
         "Hmm, this might be fun to pass time." 

(A pause. The monsters' roar above suddenly sounds, closer.) 

Red XIII 
         "They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!" 

(A deafening roar.) 

Barret 
         "Cloud! Hurry up and make up your mind!" 

(Cloud arranges his party.) 

Cloud 
         "All of you!" 

(They turn to look. Cloud waves.) 

Cloud 
         "Later!" 

(A pause. The monsters sound closer than ever.) 

Barret 
         "Yeah, later." 

(Cloud descends into the crater. Leaping from one stone platform to 
another and fighting massive enemies along the way, Cloud arrives at the 
bottom. He arrives on a strange crystalline platform seemingly made up of 
cubes and triangles. The green mist howls along the edges.) 

Cloud 
         "Where are we...?" 

(They hear an inhuman howl.) 

Tifa 
         "What!?" 

(Jenova, a serpentine woman from the waist up and a huge skull from the 
waist down, appears from the mist.) 

Cloud 
         "Jenova...!?" 

(They assume fighting stances as Jenova rushes toward them.) 

(Boss battle with Jenova-SYNTHESIS) 

(FMV sequence. The cubes and pillars that make up the platform begin to 
break up, rocketing skyward past the party. As the last of the platform 
disintegrates, the party falls down toward the green glow, absorbed in it. 
The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 141
- Judgment Day - The One-Winged Angel -

(Cloud falls in slow-motion through blackness. The only light is from a 
glowing white sphere in the center of the screen. It pulsates with energy 
as though it were a beating heart. Cloud continues to fall toward it.) 

         Li......ght...... 
         A light........ 
         Is this....... 
         Is this light...... Holy?

(He falls into the light. The scene abruptly changes. The core of the 
Planet. In the undulating green glow is a round, red stone structure. It 
forms tendrils, almost but not quite concealing what is inside- a 
pulsating white sphere. The structure is surrounded by many smaller 
stone platforms. The entire party rests unconscious on these. After a 
moment, Barret stands.) 

Barret 
         "Oww... damn, man!" 

(Cloud gets to his feet.) 

Cloud 
         "Barret!?" 

(The rest of the party comes to.) 

Barret 
         "What...? So everyone's together again...?" 

(Suddenly, a ring of white fire shoots from the center of the sphere. The 
party is levitated, struggling, into the air.) 

         "Uuuugh...!!" 

(Sephiroth's face flashes in front of the camera for a split second. His 
theme begins to play as he vanishes, only to reappear, materializing from 
the center of the sphere.) 

Cloud 
         "...Sephiroth!!" 

(Another ring of white fire emanates from the sphere, driving the party 
further from Sephiroth.) 

Barret 
         "Ugh...! Is this...... the true power of Sephiroth?" 

Cid 
         "My... my body... I can't control my body...... Uuugh!?" 

(Sephiroth draws the party nearer with his mental powers, only to torment 
them with another fire ring.) 

Red XIII 
         "My front legs...... my hind legs...... my tail's about to tear 
off!!" 

Cait Sith 
         "This is definitely not good...... He's way outta our league..." 

Yuffie 
         "I, I don't know if I can... go on..." 

(The screen flashes and the party spins in the air like toys.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud... Cloud..." 

Cloud 
         "Ugh... ugh..." 

(Again.) 

Cloud 
         "...there..." 
         "It's...... there..." 

Tifa 
         "Cloud...?" 

(Again.) 

Cloud 
         "...Holy...... Holy... is there......" 
         "The Holy is shining...... Aerith's prayer is shining......!" 

Tifa 
         "Holy...... Aerith......" 

(Again.) 

Cloud 
         "It's not over yet...... This isn't the
end yet!!" 

(Cloud assembles his party and prepares for the final battle. Sephiroth 
unleashes a final fire ring that drives away all the characters not in the 
current party.) 

         "Eyaaaah-----!" 

Tifa 
         "...We're not gonna lose!!" 

(She floats up above Sephiroth.) 

Tifa 
         "Aerith is here... everyone is here... Cloud is here with us!" 
         "There's still many things for us to do... I'm not giving up!!" 

(Cid floats up alongside Tifa.) 

Cid 
         "Hoo-ok......! I can't be foolin' around in the bottom of this 
hell hole..." 
         "I still have lots of stuff to do with my life!" 

(Cloud floats directly in front of Sephiroth.) 

Cloud 
         "Aerith's memories... Our memories..." 
         "We came... to tell you... our memories... Come Planet! Show us 
your answer!" 
         "And Sephiroth! To the settling of everything!!" 

(The screen flashes. The rock structure and green haze begin to waver, 
undulate, and finally collapse in on themselves, leaving the party and 
Sephiroth suspended in darkness. Sephiroth draws the party in to him and 
transforms.) 

(Boss battle with Bizzaro Sephiroth) 

(As Bizarro Sephiroth goes down, he transforms again. The battlefield 
fades to black, then reappears as a spinning, wavering backdrop of bright 
purple clouds. Sephiroth shows himself as he descends from the heavens. He 
is Seraph Sephiroth. The final opponent. The One-Winged Angel. An unseen, 
heavenly choir begins to chant ominously as the ultimate battle for the 
Planet commences:

        Estuans interius 
        Ira vehementi 
        Sephiroth! 
        Sors immanis 
        Et inanis 
        Sephiroth! 
        Veni, veni, venias 
        Ne me mori facias 
        Sephiroth!) 

(Boss Battle with Seraph Sephiroth) 

(Cloud and his friends deliver the final blow to Seraph Sephiroth. With a 
great flash of light, his body begins to break apart. Rays of light 
emanate from his body as he disintegrates into tiny particles that are 
absorbed into the purple clouds behind, above, everywhere. The scene fades 
to black.) 


  Scene 142
- Ghost -

(The scene fades in- Cloud and the others are gathered near the stone 
pathway at the lip of the final crater. All are exhausted from the stress 
of the journey; Barret leans against the far wall, Yuffie lies panting on 
the ground; Cait Sith is drooped over his stuffed moogle; Red XIII rests, 
his head on his paws; Vincent stands in his usual Vincent pose, arms 
crossed, distant; Cid sits, leaning forward, dozing. Cloud gazes down 
into the green glow of the crater. Tifa stands behind him, watching him.) 

Cloud 
         "This was all we could do." 

(He looks up. Barret stands.) 

Barret 
         "Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?" 

(Cloud turns to look at him. He shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "That... I don't know. Isn't the rest up to the Planet?" 

Tifa 
         "...You're right." 
         "We've done all that we could do." 

(Cloud looks at her for a moment, then looks around at the others.) 

Cloud 
         "All right, everyone." 
         "It's no use thinking about it." 
         "We'll leave all our worries here." 

(He raises one fist.) 

Cloud 
         "Let's go home proud." 

(He lowers it. The others all rise wearily and begin to trudge back to the 
exit of the crater. Cloud and Tifa walk together for a few steps when the 
screen flashes white. Cloud stops in his tracks. Tifa turns.) 

Tifa 
         "What happened?" 

(He lowers his head.) 

Cloud 
         "......I feel it..." 

Tifa 
         "What......" 

(The screen goes white, longer this time, with the sound of rushing wind. 
Cloud shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "He is still...... here." 

(Again. Cloud falls to the ground, clutching his head, and we see Cloud's 
double, white and ghostlike, fall with him.) 

Cloud 
         "Still......" 

(The screen goes white.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!?" 

(It fades. Cloud is in tremors, still tightly clutching his head.) 

Cloud 
         "He's... laughing..." 

(Cloud's double removes from his body and spins off into the distance. The 
screen goes white once more.) 

Tifa 
         "Cloud!" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  Scene 143
- The Beginning of the End -

(FMV sequence. Cloud rockets headfirst through a strange tunnel. The very 
air moves out of his way as he shoots faster and faster. The walls of the 
tunnel seem to be intangible; made up of air or steam or thoughts. Cloud 
can almost glimpse past memories as he travels; for split-seconds we hear 
the sweet piano of Aerith's theme or the low cello and clangs of church 
bells of Sephiroth. The tunnel ends and Cloud floats through a vast black 
space; bright blue tendrils of whatever untouchable stuff this world is 
made of waft past. He enters another tunnel, this one of stone, then 
water, then air. As the tunnel ends, Cloud opens his eyes and sees exactly 
who he had expected. Sephiroth. He narrows his eyes and prepares to square 
off against his archenemy in the depths of his subconscious.) 

(Battle sequence with Sephiroth. The two face each other. Cloud, leaning 
forward, his sword-grip tight with anticipation. Sephiroth, shirtless, 
holding his Masamune at eye level, catlike. The camera switches rapidly 
between the two, their eyes filled with hate as they glare at each other, 
their swords at the ready. Cloud's inner energy steadily climbs until his 
Limit is prepared. He leaps into the air and summons a Limit he hadn't 
known up to this point- an Omnislash. Sephiroth barely moves as Cloud 
comes screaming down at him, his sword dealing two, five, a dozen, twenty 
blows, fire burning behind each and every one. With the final stroke, 
Cloud leaps into the air, gathering energy. Light streams into the sword, 
reaching a pinpoint, and Cloud brings it down. Sephiroth stumbles, 
clutching his chest, then falls to his knees. His piercing, hateful eyes 
continue to stare at Cloud as the scene fades to black.) 








Scene 144
- The End of the Beginning -

(FMV sequence. Sephiroth, bloodied, a expression of shock and horror on 
his face, rises, flailing, into the air. Rays of white light emanate from 
his body, increasing in intensity for a few moments before Sephiroth 
disappears, somewhat anticlimactically, in a small shower of glowing red 
embers.) 

(Cloud watches his rival vanish, panting from the intensity of the battle, 
a slight smile of victory on his face. His attention is abruptly removed 
from the now empty air to the area around his feet. Green tendrils and 
droplets of lively energy snake upwards around his body as he watches with 
wonder, raising his hands in an attempt to touch the intangible green. A 
second presence, this one pink, joins the green as they coil themselves 
around Cloud, the only light to be seen in the darkness. They bring more 
and more of themselves reeling inwards, forming a tight sphere of 
brightness around him before they dissipate, leaving only streams of green 
weaving into a column around him. Cloud watches them as they waft upward.) 

         .......Lifestream? 

(They too float lazily outward, dissipating, leaving only green spheres, 
dancing around Cloud. The air above, around him, in him, takes on a bright 
green-white glow. Aerith's theme begins to play softly in the background. 
Cloud gazes upward, the green dots still bouncing happily. He raises his 
hand to meet that above him. The camera moves out to show the green light 
pouring down around Cloud from above, a perfect column until it washes out 
along the ground at his feet, as if it were solid. One fragile, graceful 
hand reaches down from amidst the source of the light, toward Cloud's 
hand, as Aerith's theme continues. Cloud smiles broadly in his joy, at l
ast united with 

(Tifa stretches her hand toward Cloud, perched on a narrow ledge on the 
wall of the Northern Crater. Massive boulders and debris crumble from the 
walls around her as the Northern Crater begins its collapse. She is too 
far away. Cloud falls. Cloud snaps to his senses as the tiny rock ledge he 
is balanced on slips further, cracking beneath his feet, inches from 
tumbling to the green Mako ocean at the bottom of the crater. Tifa falls. 
Her platform crumbles away, sending her plummeting headfirst towards the 
sea of green. With lightning speed, Cloud rushes toward the wall of the 
crater, his feet somehow finding the tiniest footholds, leaps toward the 
crater wall, catches Tifa by the waist as she falls past, and grabs a 
handhold at the lip of a larger rock ledge, leaving him dangling 
precariously by one hand, Tifa held tightly by his side.) 

         ......I think I'm beginning to understand. 

(Tifa looks up at him.) 

         What? 

(She holds on tighter and leans her head against his chest.) 

         An answer from the Planet... 
         the Promised Land... 
         I think I can meet her... there. 

(Tifa looks up at him, then closes her eyes and leans her head back down.) 

         Yeah, let's go meet her. 

(Cloud begins to pull the two of them up to the ledge. The Mako pool 
begins to glow white, shifting colors. Cloud and Tifa make their way up 
and sit down. Cloud looks at her.) 

         Hey, where is everyone? 

(The camera shifts to show Cait Sith, Barret, Cid, and Red XIII reclining 
on another ledge across the crater. Barret looks up and waves.) 

         Heeeey! 

(Tifa happily waves to them.) 

         I'm glad you're all safe! 

(The camera moves behind the others. Barret looks at Cid.) 

         They all seem to be safe, too. 
         But... now what're we going to do? 

(He looks out across the crater. Red XIII rises to his feet.) 

         Holy should be moving soon, 
         and that means this place will... 

(Cid stands and looks up out of the crater.) 

         Oh, Lady Luck don't fail me now... 

(He gapes and his cigarette falls from his mouth. Cloud and Tifa, then the 
rest of the party follow suit and look up to see the Highwind come 
crashing down. It shoots nose-first into the crater, crashing into the 
walls and dislodging more rocks and debris before finally coming to a 
stop, wedged between the stone walls, the bikini-clad woman painted on 
the side still winking and smiling vacuously.) 

(The scene shifts to the area outside the Crater. The Mako inside glows, 
grows, and explodes from the crater, sending a circle of energy outwards 
as it blasts skyward in a perfect white column. The force of the explosion 
propels the Highwind out of the crater, spinning wildly. The camera moves 
to the deck to show the party as they slide this way and that and struggle 
to hold on to the railing as the ship flips in the air. Cid catches hold 
of a steel pipe bolted to the floor.) 

         Shit!! 

(He pulls himself up and stretches to reach a lever marked 'Emergency.' He 
pulls it and the Highwind transforms again into a sleek craft resembling a 
jet plane more than a blimp. With the extra control, the ship rolls out of 
the Mako explosion and screams off toward the horizon.) 

(The scene shifts. The view is blocked by fog until the camera passes 
through it, revealing a birds-eye view of Kalm village. The camera 
continues downward, swinging to show the lone window in the tower, the 
tallest building in the city, the shutters closed. The scene shifts to the 
room inside. Marlene is seated at a small table. The table is clear except 
for a single mug and Marlene's hands. She stares at them, twisting them in 
worry. Suddenly, she looks up.) 

         The flower girl? 

(She turns and looks inquisitively at the shutters. She rises and swings 
them open to see red fire consuming the world. Meteor hangs low in the 
sky. It has almost reached the earth, so close that its fire is beginning 
to scorch the land. The scene shifts to Midgar. The camera looks up past 
steel beams and towers at Meteor as red tornadoes of flame begin to touch 
down. They sweep through the city, mercilessly smashing massive metal 
structures like so many straws. Shinra headquarters is no exception. The 
columns of fire cut swaths of destruction through the metropolis, razing 
filthy slums and upper-class residential zones alike.) 

(Holy comes. At first merely a white pinpoint in the distance, then 
growing, accelerating toward Meteor, a mighty wave of white magic. It 
rushes in between Meteor and Midgar, clipping the tip of what used to be 
Shinra headquarters. The scene shifts briefly back to Kalm village. 
Marlene, still watching from the window, squints and holds up a hand to 
the blinding white light. The scene moves to show Bugenhagen's 
observatory, Meteor and Holy so huge as to be visible even from here, the
other side of the world.) 

(The scene moves back to above Midgar. Meteor continues its slow, slow 
descent toward land. As it reaches Holy, dots of ember and tongues of 
flame lick upwards along its red-hot surface and Holy glows pink around 
its edges rather than white. The camera shifts to the ground outside 
Midgar, looking up at Holy, the remnants of homes and buildings below. 
A red spot forms on Holy's underside as Meteor brushes it. Then, all of 
Holy begins to burn red and a huge, perfectly round hole opens above 
Midgar. Its diameter is exactly the same as that of the city. The camera 
moves to just outside Shinra HQ. The air begins to burn red and the last 
framework of the building begins to explode as Meteor's wrath pours 
through.) 

(The scene shifts to the sky. The Highwind continues to circle at a safe 
distance from Midgar. The party, assembled on the bridge, watches the 
destruction through the bay window. Cloud and Tifa stand together near the 
panel. Barret comes over to stand behind them.) 

         Wait a damn minute! 

(He looks over at the rest of the group.) 

         What's going to happen to Midgar? 

(He slams his fist down.) 

         We can't let that happen! 

(Cait Sith begins to gesture frantically.) 

         I had everyone take refuge in the slums, 

(He looks down at the floor, shaking his head.) 

         but the way things are now... 

(He wipes a tear with the back of one of his white cartoon gloves. Red 
XIII comes forward, the red fire below further reddening his coat.) 

         It's too late for Holy. 
         Meteor is approaching the Planet. 

(The camera shifts to show Meteor and Holy still decimating Midgar.) 

         Holy is having the opposite effect. 

(The camera shifts back to Red XIII, slowly zooming in on his one good 
eye, glittering in the light.) 

         Forget Midgar, 
         we've gotta worry about the Planet. 

(The Highwind continues to circle. The camera shifts to show Cid working 
frantically at the control panel, then to show Cloud sitting on the 
railing in front of the window, his back to the destruction outside, as 
Tifa continues to watch fearfully. Cloud looks at her. The camera moves to 
show her face. Her eyes widen in surprise.) 

         What's that!? 

(The camera shifts to show a sky view of a remote, mountainous area of the 
eastern continent. A tiny pinprick of green light is visible in one dark 
moor. The camera shifts down to ground level. The green light grows and 
one bright tendril of the Lifestream worms its way out from the ground. A 
large hole opens in the ground around the stream, revealing the Lifestream 
boiling just below the surface, one thread escaping into the air.) 

(The camera shifts to another location in the mountains. Another strand of 
the Lifestream is emanating from the ground curving gracefully in Midgar's 
direction. It shifts again. Two more. They grow. Then three. Then four. 
Then five.) 

(The scene shifts back to the bridge of the Highwind. Cloud, Tifa, and 
Barret are gripping the railing at the very front, watching with wonder as 
more and more arms of green burrow out from the ground.) 

         What the hell IS that......? 

(The camera closes in on Cloud, an empty expression on his face.) 

         ......Lifestream. 

(The Lifestream emanates in three more spots, twisting together as they 
move along the ground. The camera shifts back to Kalm village. A light 
comes on in one window, then another opens, and another. Within moments, 
every soul in Kalm is leaning out one window or another, watching 
silently. The camera moves to show Marlene once more, leaning on the 
highest windowsill in the town, her eyes wide, but expressionless.) 

         It's coming. 

(The Lifestream continues to rush from the earth. It is streaming from 
nearly every spot on the ground now, turning the earth into a massive 
pool of green. Midgar continues to crumble.) 

(A tidal wave of green closes in on the city, arms of Lifestream swaying 
and undulating gracefully, marching along. The air is nearly a solid mass 
of green. The camera swings up, past Meteor, chunks still dislodged from 
its surface from its encounter with Shinra No. 26. The camera swings up, 
up, higher and higher above the earth. The entire continent comes into 
view, spewing Lifestream from every crack and pore, a thousand-mile-wide 
net of green light covering everything, closing in on Midgar, Holy, and 
Meteor.) 

(The camera flips to each party member in turn. Barret. Red XIII. 
Cait Sith. Cid. Marlene. Tifa. Cloud. All squeeze their eyes shut from 
the sheer power of the blinding green-white light. The Lifestream 
surrounds Meteor, adhering to it, dissolving it.) 

(Aerith in darkness, her eyes closed. Green embers floating upward around 
her. She opens her eyes and looks directly at you, a sweet, kind smile on 
her lips.)

     Ah, too bad I'm not a better ASCII artist. Welcome to the Final 
Fantasy VII Script.

     The way I transcribed the different choices ("I don't care / OK, let's 
go," and the like) requires a little bit of explanation:


<CHOICE>
	Do this
	Do that

***Lead character
	Do this

(Here's all the stuff that happens when you do this)

***Lead character
      Do that

(Here's all the stuff that happens when you do that)

<//>

(Here's all the stuff that happens no matter whether you do this or that)


The actual choices are somewhat more interesting.

     If you discover any grammatical errors, misspellings, or typos, or if 
you have a question, comment, or suggestion about the script, I much 
appreciate it if you email me about it so I can try to incorporate it 
into the next versions.

     An enhanced version of this script with HTML formatting, music, and 
screenshots of the entire game is available at my website at

transcribing it. Sit back, plant your finger squarely on that down-arrow

(At one time or another, Cloud will be fighting in a forest. Sometimes, 
he will encounter a mysterious Ninja. After defeating her, the scene 
moves to the field in which they fought. The Ninja lies on the ground, 
beaten. Cloud goes over to her and she stands up.)

finished, the ninja has vanished into thin air.) 

         "No way I'm going to fight with punks like you more than once!"

         "Make fun of me, will ya! Just watch!!" 

(She runs off, crashing into Cid on the way out.) 

Cid 
         "She's gone, hey...... What's with that kid!?" 
         "What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!" 

         500 Gil stolen!

         "Good luck to you too. If you feel up to it, we can go another

         "......Hmmm. So is that it?" 
         "I know you want my help because I'm so good!"

         "Heh heh... thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should 
I do?" 
         "But if you want me that bad, I can't refuse..." 
         "All right! I'll go with you!"

(The PLAYER names Yuffie. After the character name screen disappears, she 
has vanished again.) 

         "What are you talking about!? You're the one who should go first!" 
         "Okay forget it! I'm not going with you!" 
         "Remember, if you piss me off... it'll cost you!!" 

Tifa 
         "Hey! My money!"

(Tifa runs after her.) 

Tifa 
         "Wait a second! Where's my money!?" 

(The scene ends here.) 

***Cloud 
         ......Let's hurry on 

(The scene continues.) 

<//> 

(Cloud and the party walk off, leaving Yuffie behind.) 

         "Huh? Hey... HEY!" 

(She runs after them.) 

         "Wait! I haven't even told you my name......" 

(The PLAYER names Yuffie) 

Yuffie 
         "I'm Yuffie! Good to meetcha!" 

(She turns away and starts to laugh to herself.) 

Yuffie 
         "Heh heh...... just as I planned." 
         "Now all I have to do is... a little this...... 
and a little that...... nyuk, nyuk, nyuk......" 

(She runs off after the others.) 

Yuffie 
         "Hey, wait up! Wait for me!!" 
         "Here, I'll give you back the money I stole from you!" 
         "......or, uh, what's left of it." 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  - Materia Thief - Turks Off Duty - Godo -

(Cloud and the others travel to Wutai on the westernmost continent. In 
the field on the way into the village, Yuffie appears.) 

Tifa 
         "What the--? Did something happen?" 

Yuffie 
         "I know this area pretty well." 
         "It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready..." 

Tifa 
         "...Really? Somehow, ...I don't believe it." 
         "Are you trying to con us again...?" 

Yuffie 
         "No! It's REALLY tough..."

         "There they are, catch 'em!!" 

(Two Shinra guards approach the party, guns raised.) 

Cid 
         "What, the Shinra!?" 

Shinra Soldier 
         "Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!" 

Tifa 
         "Yuffie, you're not......!" 

Yuffie 
         "I don't know! I have nothing to do with this one!" 

Tifa 
         "This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?" 
         "So you WERE trying to pull something off!" 

Yuffie 
         "No, umm, uh......" 

Shinra Soldier 
         "What should we do!?" 

Shinra Soldier 
         "Uh...... Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!" 

(Yuffie runs off as the soldiers attack.) 

(Battle sequence with two Shinra Soldiers) 

Tifa 
         "What's going on!?" 
         "I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!" 

Cid 
         "Ey... where the hell's that damn kid...?" 

(Everyone looks around the area for Yuffie. Sounds of the wind blowing.) 

Tifa 
         "She's done it to us again!!" 
         "I'm never gonna forgive her!" 
         "She was after our materia from the beginning." 
         "I won't let her get away with it! I'm pretty sure she ran off 
north. Let's go after her!!"

(They follow Yuffie into Wutai. In the village, they find her standing 
on the opposite side of a bridge.) 

Yuffie 
         "Hey!!" 

(She runs off. Cloud follows her, but she seems to have disappeared.) 

People in Wutai 

         "Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that 
planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer." 

         "Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even 
see the moon in the afternoon. Everyone's celebrating." 

         "No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's 
scared of it!!"

         "This is a weapons store of the hard cores, by the hard cores, 
and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?" 

         "Sorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind." 

         "Hey. Things look pretty sad around here." 
         "With things the way they are in the world I guess there's 
nothing I can do about it." 
         "Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all 
might as well sit back and have a beer..." 

         "First the ground started shaking, then that large star......" 
         "Yy, you think... It's all over?"

         "When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are 
going to be dust! Can't we do something?" 
         "A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing 
Da-chao for some time now." 

         "And now it's too late to be worrying about materia at this 
stage of the game..." 
         "If you see anything you need, buy it." 

         "You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?" 
         "You're an odd one..." (Sells items) 

         "The end is right in front of us..." 
         "But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day 
in and day out..." 
         "What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that." 
         "But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But 
really he's not so......"

         "Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God?" 
         "They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden 
powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames." 
         "But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that 
huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us..." 

(The party travels to the Wutai tavern. Inside, they find Reno, Rude and 
Elena drinking at one of the tables.) 

Elena 
         "Yy, you!? How did you get here...?" 

(She leaps up from the table.) 

Elena 
         "Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together." 
         "Get ready to die!!"

(She assumes a fighting stance. The party leaps over the table and 
prepares to battle.) 

Reno 
         "...Elena, you talk too much." 

(She looks at him.) 

Elena 
         "Ww, what?" 

Reno 
         "What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?" 

Elena 
         "We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work." 

Reno 
         "Now our vacation is ruined." 

Elena 
         "B, but..." 

Rude 
         "...even the booze tastes bad now." 

Elena 
         "...sorry..." 

(She sits back down. ) 

Reno 
         "Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?" 
         "There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm 
glad I did it." 
         "I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you." 

Elena 
         "Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!" 
         "The next time we meet I won't be so nice."

Rude 
         "To the Turks... To Reno...
cheers!" 

(They travel to the courtyard in the northern area of Wutai. Bordering 
one side of it is Godo's mansion. Entering, they discover Godo lying on a 
futon in a back room.) 

Godo 
         "GOOGAH... what do you want?"

         "Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to..
GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home." 
         "......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO..." 
         "...you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I 
don't know her."

(When Cloud accosts him yet again, he sits up in frustration.) 

Godo 
         "Listen, I said I don't know her! There isn't anyone named Yuffie 
here in Wutai!" 

(He stands and faces Cloud.) 

Godo 
         "...never seen you around here before..." 
         "Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... 
You wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you?" 
         "I don't care about who you are." 
         "But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to 
ask you to leave." 
         "I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my 
shoulder." 

         "What's with you, you coward!" 

(Yuffie drops down from the ceiling outside Godo's room. Godo spins to 
face her.) 

Godo 
         "Yuffie......!" 

Yuffie 
         "You scared of the Shinra?" 
         "Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like 
all of the other towns!" 

(She steps into the room and points to Cloud.) 

Yuffie 
         "Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!" 

Godo 
         "Shut up! What would you know about this?" 

Yuffie 
         "You get beaten once, and then that's it?" 
         "What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?" 

Godo 
         "No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!" 
         "You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!" 

Yuffie 
         "That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't 
you try and dictate what I should do!" 

(Godo raises his fists over his head.) 

Godo 
         "Style...? Dictate...?" 
         "Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable 
daughter!" 

Yuffie 
         "Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!" 

(Godo chases her out of the room, then stops as she runs off. He returns 
to his room, facing the wall.) 

Godo 
         "......take your things and get out of here now." 
         "To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra." 

(Cloud leaves Godo's mansion.) 
  
  
  





  - Steel Them? -

(Cloud returns to the materia shop in Wutai. A woman that was previously 
blocking access to a treasure chest in the corner of the shop is now at 
the counter, making it possible for Cloud to reach the chest. There is an 
MP Absorb materia inside. As soon as Cloud takes it, though, Yuffie drops 
down from her hiding place in the ceiling, grabs it, and runs off. Cloud 
follows. Clues from the townspeople lead him to the house next to the 
town's exit. A boy and his grandfather mill around inside.) 

         "Oh no! More weirdos." 
         "No, these aren't the ones from a while ago, but these ones 
look weird too!" 
         "What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl 
came in here a minute ago and I..." 

(Cloud folds back a dressing curtain in a corner, revealing Yuffie 
hiding behind it.) 

Yuffie 
         "......" 

(She dashes off.) 

         "Oh, how exciting! You a friend of my grandson's?" 

         "No, Gramps! These guys are creepy! They're runnin' all over the 
place!"

(Cloud leaves the house and continues to search for Yuffie. On the way 
past the tavern, he notices that a large jar outside is wobbling back and 
forth. The others block the only two bridges that offer an escape route 
away from the tavern. Cloud hits the side of the jar. No  response. He 
does it again; still nothing. One more punch does the trick and Yuffie 
pops out. Her escape attempts are thwarted by the two guarding the 
bridges.) 

Cloud 
         "You can't get away, Yuffie." 

Yuffie 
         "O.. ok, I know... I was wrong......" 
         "You win. I'll give you back your materia..." 

(Yuffie leads them away towards the house where she has the materia 
stashed. As they leave, we see two Shinra guards behind them run into the 
tavern. The scene shifts to the tavern's interior as the guards enter. 
Elena stands up from the table.)

Shinra soldier 
         "So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!" 
         "We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!" 

Reno 
         "...what a drag." 

Shinra soldier 
         "Ww, what was that...?" 

Reno 
         "Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts." 

Shinra soldier 
         "We know you're off duty, but..." 

Reno 
         "If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' 
me sober." 

Shinra soldier 
         "But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!" 

(Reno doesn't move.) 

Shinra soldier 
         "All right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the 
Turks, just you see!" 

(The soldiers run out of the tavern. A second later, one pops back in.) 

Shinra soldier 
         "And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about 
this!!" 

(He runs off.) 

Elena 
         "Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?" 
         "I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?" 

Reno 
         "Elena. Don't misunderstand." 
         "A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's 
just a fool." 

Elena 
         "Rude...?" 

Rude 
         "........." 

Elena 
         "Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!" 

(She runs out of the tavern.) 

Rude 
         "........." 

Reno 
         "Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now..."

(The scene shifts to Yuffie's house.) 

Yuffie 
         "I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. 
...Follow me." 

(She goes downstairs. Cloud follows. As he arrives downstairs, Yuffie is 
standing in the middle of a large basement, the walls lined with statues.) 

Yuffie 
         "...I've been hearing that ever since I was little." 
         "Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more 
important..." 

(She goes to stand in a corner.)

Yuffie 
         "You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town..." 
         "After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost 
something else. Now look at Wutai..." 

(She stands in the doorway, her back to the party.) 

Yuffie 
         "That's why... if I had lots of materia I could..." 

(She starts to sniffle.)

Cloud 
         "Listen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your 
feelings." 
         "You've got our materia and I want it back ...now." 
         "If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing." 

Yuffie 
         "I know, I know that..." 
         "That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left........ 
materia's... sniff, hic... in there."

(Cloud walks to the back of the back of the basement. There is a control 
panel with two levers and a monitor with the word OFF displayed on a green 
field. He pulls the lever on the left. The monitor changes to a large red 
ON. A metal cage suddenly drops from the ceiling, trapping the other two 
party members.) 

Cid 
         "Whoa!?" 

(The camera pans down to show Yuffie, who has given up on sniffling and 
commenced to laughing.) 

Yuffie 
         "Ha ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!!" 
         "The Materia's mine! Tough!" 

(She runs up the stairs, stops, and runs back down.) 

Yuffie 
         "You want your materia? Then go find it yourself!" 
         "Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, 
remember you gotta steel it." 
         "Heh heh... steel... steel! Get it?" 
         "C ya!" 

(She runs off. Cloud flips the other lever, the monitor reverts to OFF, 
and the cage rises. He sets off yet again in pursuit of Yuffie.) 
  
  
  





  - Corneo Revisited - Truce - Because It's Our Job. -

(Cloud travels to the courtyard in northern Wutai. There is a small shrine 
enclosing a gong at one side. Cloud rings the gong and a hidden door opens 
in the side of the shrine. Cloud enters. Inside is a small storeroom. In 
the center stands a man dressed in a suit, holding a struggling Yuffie.) 

Yuffie 
         "Let go! I SAID let GO!" 
         "Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!" 

(The man runs deeper into the room. Cloud runs after him.) 

Cloud 
         "You......!" 

        ".........ho.......... .......................ho............" 

(The camera pans up to show Don Corneo observing Yuffie still thrashing 
in his flunkies' grip, hands clasped, looking quite pleased.) 

Corneo 
         "Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!" 

Cloud 
         "Corneo!?" 

(The Don does a little curtsy.) 

Corneo 
         "Hohi!" 
         "I've finally got a new chicky!" 
         "Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!" 

Cloud 
         "Two!?" 

(The camera pans up to show another flunky holding a flailing Elena.) 

Elena 
         "H..... hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!" 

(Both flunkies carry their repective women up some stairs in the back of 
the room.) 

Corneo 
         "Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!"

(The Don runs up the stairs as well. Cloud follows him. They both emerge 
through a door next to a small shrine in a back room of Godo's mansion. 
The Shinra soldiers rush into the room, blocking the Don's way out as he 
tries to escape.) 

Shinra soldier 
         "There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!" 

(Don spins worriedly as one of the soldiers raises his gun.) 

Shinra soldier 
         "Attaaaaack!" 

(The soldiers rush at Don, who jumps nimbly out of the way, sending the 
soldiers crashing into Cloud.) 

(Battle sequence with three Shinra guards) 

(Cloud rushes out of Godo's mansion. He runs into Reno and Rude on their 
way out of the courtyard.) 

Rude 
         "......Elena." 

Reno 
         "Hmm.... that Corneo is good at escaping..." 

Rude 
         "......Elena." 

Reno 
         "Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can 
do." 

(Rude nods and runs off.) 

Reno 
         "......Sounded pretty good." 

(He turns to Cloud.) 

Reno 
         "If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little 
difficult." 
         "And uh..." 

Cloud 
         "......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us." 
         "And without Yuffie, there's no way to get our materia back." 

Reno 
         "Don't misunderstand." 
         "We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree 
not to bother each other. That's all." 

Cloud 
         "That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with 
the Turks either." 
         "Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?" 

Reno 
         "Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands 
out the most." 

(Reno runs off. Cloud follows him to Dachao, the carved mountains, to 
the northeast. He finds Reno and Rude on the path there.) 

Reno 
         "You're finally here. We're gonna split into two." 
         "You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena." 
         "Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie." 
         "For now..." 

(He half-salutes and runs down the path, followed closely by Rude and then 
Cloud. All three head down the road through the mountains shaped like 
giant people, arriving at last on one colossal stone hand. The scene 
shifts to show the huge hand before Cloud and the others arrive. Don 
Corneo is perched atop the middle finger. Strapped to the eyes of a huge 
stone head in the background are Elena and an energetically struggling 
Yuffie. The hand and head are a long way up from the ground.)

Yuffie 
         "LET... ME...... GO!!!!" 

Corneo 
         "Hmm! Delicious... scrumptious! I think I've found a new HOBBY!" 
         "Which shall it be? Hmm... Hmm..."  

(He walks down the palm and waggles at
Elena.) 

Corneo 
         "Should I go... with HER?" 

Elena 
         "He... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't you think you can get 
away with this!?" 

(He walks onto one finger and does a little dance at Yuffie.) 

Corneo 
         "Or... maybe... HER?" 

Yuffie 
         "Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken 
rope escape lessons more seriously!!" 

(Corneo turns to the camera.) 

Corneo 
         "Hmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will 
be......" 

(He turns to Yuffie) 

Corneo 
         "...the cheerful one!" 

(Yuffie thrashes with a renewed vigor.) 

Yuffie 
         "GROSS-NESS!" 
         "Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!" 

Corneo 
         "Oooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!" 

         "All right, that's it!!" 

(Corneo backs away, onto the middle finger.) 

Corneo 
         "Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?" 

(Cloud and the others arrive on the huge stone wrist.) 

Yuffie 
         "Oh man! Cloud......!" 

Corneo 
         "Wheee! ...long time no see." 

Cloud 
         "Don't tell me you forgot..." 

Tifa 
         "That fall into the trap really hurt!" 

Cid 
         "Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!" 

Corneo 
         "Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then..." 

(He turns away and looks contemplative.) 

Corneo 
         "It's a long story, but......" 

(Flowing, reminiscent harp music begins to play... then is abruptly cut 
off) 

Tifa 
         "We don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!" 

(Corneo turns to face them.) 

Corneo 
         "Hmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good." 
         "...this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either..." 
         "Why did you kill my little Aps?" 
         "I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in 
the way of my search for a bride!" 

(The party prepares for battle. Corneo melodramatically falls to one knee 
and raises his arms)

Corneo 
         "RAPPS--- come here!!" 

(Boss battle with Rapps) 

Corneo 
         "Wait..." 
         "Just wait a second!" 

Cloud 
         "SHUT UP!" 

Corneo 
         "Just listen to me - it won't take
long." 
         "Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and 
plead for his life?" 

<CHOICE> 
         1 Because he's ready to die 
         2 Because he's sure to win 
         3 Because he's clueless 

***Cloud 
         1 Because he's ready to die 

Corneo 
         "Buzzzz! Wrong!" 

***Cloud 
         2 Because he's sure to win 

Corneo 
         "Woo-hoo! Right!" 

***Cloud 
         3 Because he's clueless 

Corneo 
         "Hmm...! Close, but no cigar...!" 
<//> 

(Both eyes of the stone head rotate, flipping Elena and Yuffie upside 
down.)

Elena 
         "Eyaaah...!" 

Yuffie 
         "Makes me so MAD...!" 

Corneo 
         "If I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have 
SQUASHED TOMATOES!" 

Cloud 
         "Damn...!" 

Tifa 
         "Coward!" 

Cid 
         "So this is how a loser lives...!" 

Corneo 
         "Now, give me your women too!" 
         "Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I'm the one laughing last!" 

         "No, that would be us." 

Corneo 
         "Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?" 

(Reno enters along the arm and stands atop the man-sized thumb.) 

Corneo 
         "...The Turks!" 

(All turn to face Reno.) 

Reno 
         "You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that 
secret." 
         "We're going to take care of you... personally." 

Corneo 
         "DAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!" 

(Rude quickly darts out from a path behind the giant stone head. He throws 
a tiny weapon at the Don.) 

Corneo 
         "Ugh...!" 

(Corneo grimaces in pain, teeters backward and falls off the finger, 
barely managing to grab the end before he falls.) 

Reno 
         "Good timing, Rude." 

(Rude raises a hand.) 

Rude 
         "...Let's get to work." 

(Reno hops off the thumb and walks over to where the Don clings. He puts 
one shoe on the Don's fingers.) 

Reno 
         "All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up." 
         "Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with 
those guys to get you...?" 

         1. Because we were ready to die 
         2. Because we were sure of victory 
         3. Because we were clueless 

(Corneo nods frantically) 

Corneo 
         "Two... Number two?" 

Reno 
         "All wrong." 

(He wiggles the foot pinning the Don's fingers.) 

Corneo 
         "No...! Wait, sto......!" 

(Reno takes his foot off. Corneo falls.) 

Corneo 
 "Aaaaaaaaaa......p" 

(Reno pushes his sunglasses farther up his nose and stares down into the 
canyon.) 

Reno 
         "The correct answer was..." 

(A pause.) 

Reno 
         "...because it's our job." 

Elena 
         "Oh, thank you very much...!" 
         "I never expected you to come help......" 

(Reno turns to her, still suspended from the stone head.) 

Reno 
         "Don't act so weak." 
         "You're a Turk!" 

Elena 
         "Y... Yes, sir!" 

(A beat) 

Cid 
         "I guess, thanks for today." 

Rude 
         "......" 

(Reno's cell phone rings. He answers) 

Reno 
         "Yes... this is Reno." 
         "Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away." 

Elena 
         "Was that the company?" 

Reno 
         "Yeah, they want us to find Cloud..." 

(He puts the phone back into the pocket on the inside of his jacket. He 
turns to Cloud and the others. They assume fighting stances.) 

(A long pause.) 

Rude 
         "Are we on...?" 

(Reno runs his fingers through his hair.) 

Reno 
         "No, today we're off duty." 

(A long pause.) 

(Yuffie resumes struggling.) 

Yuffie 
         "Hey--- who cares about that!? Get---- me----- down----!" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  - Materia Regained -

(The scene fades in to Yuffie's room. Cloud and the others watch as she 
hops around, replacing their materia.) 

Yuffie 
         "Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place." 

Cloud 
         "Hey... the placement of it is all messed up." 

Yuffie 
         "Huh? Oh, it'll be all right..." 
         "Don't be so picky!" 
         "Anyways, that sure was close......" 
         "No, normally I would kick their butts. Boom, Bang!!" 

(She shadow-boxes briefly.) 

Tifa 
         "That Corneo guy's a real pain." 

(Yuffie looks down at the floor.) 

Yuffie 
         "I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy." 

(Cloud and the others leave the house, leaving Yuffie behind, still 
looking down.) 

Yuffie 
         "Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, 
huh?" 
         "At least, after all that, we got the materia back." 
         "Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey..." 

(She looks up) 

Yuffie 
         "......Hey!! W... Wait!" 

(She runs into the bedroom area of the house and starts rifling through a 
drawer.) 

Yuffie 
         "Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys." 

(She runs out) 

Yuffie 
         "Here, look, look!" 

(She holds up an MP Absorb materia.) 

Yuffie 
         "........." 

(She runs out of the house.) 

Yuffie 
         "Come on, wait---!" 
         "No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!" 
         "...next time......" 

(The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
  





  - Brave the Pagoda - Godo -

(The party, Yuffie in tow, returns to Wutai. They travel to the pagoda 
near the northern courtyard. They try to climb the stairs to the second 
floor, but the guard on the first floor catches them.) 

         "Freeze!" 
         "Miss Yuffie! You cannot go to the second floor unless you defeat 
me!" 
         "Oh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Yeah, that's it 
         No way! 

***Yuffie 
         Yeah, that's it 

***Yuffie 
         No way! 
<//> 

         "Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!" 

(A small child runs down the stairs from the second floor.) 

         "Yo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!" 

Gorky 
         "Then, begin!" 

(Yuffie prepares for battle.) 

Gorky 
         "Power Change!" 

(Battle sequence with Gorky) 

Gorky 
         "Here I am, Miss Yuffie!" 

Yuffie 
         "Of course!" 

Shake 
         "Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that 
pretty well!" 
         "Well, we'll see how well you do on the next one..." 

(They climb to the second floor, where Shake awaits.) 

Yuffie 
         "Who's next?" 

Shake 
         "Are you blind? I'm right here?" 

Yuffie 
         "What? I gotta fight a punk?" 

Shake 
         "Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!" 

Yuffie 
         "Wh, what did you say!?" 

Shake 
         "See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so 
immature!" 
         "Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!" 

Yuffie 
         "Now watch...!" 

Shake 
         "'Bout the only thing you can do really good is breathe! Sure 
you're brave enough to fight?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Stop yappin'! 
         I'll forgive you 

***Yuffie 
         Stop yappin'! 

         "Hm, so somebody finally got past Gorky." 

***Yuffie 
         I'll forgive you 

Shake 
         "So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!" 
<//> 

(A man comes down from the third floor.) 

         "So, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in..."

Shake 
         "Here I go, brat! Speed Change!" 

(Battle sequence with Shake) 

Shake 
         "URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!" 

Yuffie 
         "Of course!" 

Chekhov 
         "Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain..."

(Chekhov goes upstairs. Cloud and the others follow. An older man comes 
down from the fourth floor.) 

         "So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had 
to fight, Chekhov." 

Chekhov 
         "Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch 
over there." 

Yuffie 
         "That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength 
of youth!" 

Chekhov 
         "Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to 
get burned." 

<CHOICE> 
         I got insurance 
         Let's get this over with, old bag 

***Yuffie 
         I got insurance 

***Yuffie 
         Let's get this over with, old bag 

Chekhov 
         "Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of 
diapers!?" 

Staniv 
         "First, Chekhov will keep you company..." 

(Staniv moves to block the stairs up.) 
<//> 

Chekhov 
         "Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you can still talk like that after you 
taste some of my Sacred Magic..." 
         "Magic Change!" 

(Battle sequence with Chekhov) 

Chekhov 
         "I can't believe you beat me..." 

Yuffie 
         "Of course!" 

Staniv 
         "This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've 
had a chance to use my powers to their fullest..." 

(Staniv goes upstairs. Cloud and the others follow.) 

Staniv 
         "The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your 
opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the 
highest..." 
         "In other words, no one has ever defeated me-- Master of 
Weaponry!" 
         "You still want to try...?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Just come on!! 
         I'll pass! 

***Yuffie 
         Just come on!! 

***Yuffie 
         I'll pass! 

Staniv 
         "You don't seem to be the kind of person who can make it to the 
fourth floor without a problem..." 
<//>

Staniv 
         "I like you! Now watch..." 
         "Weapon Change!" 

(Battle sequence with Staniv) 

Staniv 
         "Wh, what...!?" 

Yuffie 
         "Of course!" 

(Gorky comes up from the third floor.)

Gorky 
         "Splendid! Your level and skill have improved..." 

(Gorky stands behind Staniv. Shake arrives.) 

Shake 
         "Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a kid as we thought you 
were!" 

(Shake stands next to Gorky. Chekhov arrives.) 

Chekhov 
         "Of course. If WE lost to her..." 

(He stands next to Shake.) 

Staniv 
         "You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to 
face HIM......!"

(All four file upstairs. Cloud and the others follow. When they arrive, 
the four floor guardians at lined against the wall. Godo stands at the 
front of the room.) 

Yuffie 
         "D, dad!?" 

Godo 
         "I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!" 

Yuffie 
         "Why, why are you......" 

(Godo flexes.) 

Godo 
         "I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!" 
         "Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you 
don't... then I'll have to kill you!"

Yuffie 
         "H... hey!" 

(Godo rushes forward.) 

Godo 
         "What are you doing! OMNI- Change!.....!!" 

(Boss battle with Godo) 

(After the battle, Godo and Yuffie end up lying on the floor, panting and 
exhausted from the fighting.)

Yuffie 
         "...heave......heave..." 

Godo 
         "...huff...... puff......" 

Yuffie 
         "O... old coot... n......ot... bad..." 

Godo 
         "You've...... also...... improved..." 

(A pause) 

Yuffie 
         "Hah... Ha, ha......" 

(A pause) 

Godo 
         "...Heh, heh......" 

Yuffie 
         "Ha ha haaaaa......!" 

Godo 
         "Waha haaaaa......!" 

(They both start laughing hysterically. The scene fades to black for a 
moment. When it fades back in, Yuffie and Godo have regained their 
composure and stood up.) 

Godo 
         "It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie..." 
         "This is Leviathan Materia. Take it." 

(Godo tosses the Leviathan materia to Yuffie.) 

Staniv 
         "But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to 
the person who conquers this Pagoda. That is our custom..." 

Yuffie 
         "CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!" 
         "It's so stupid!" 

Gorky 
         "Silence, Miss Yuffie!" 

Yuffie 
         "Then what 'bout all the rest of you? You have all that power..." 
         "Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?" 

Godo 
         "Yuffie...!" 

(Yuffie runs over to him) 

Yuffie 
         "You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!" 
         "And turning Wutai into a place like this!" 

Chekhov 
         "...What do you want to say?" 

Yuffie 
         "You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to 
tourists..." 

(She shakes her head.) 

Yuffie 
         "How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!" 

Godo 
         "..." 

Shake 
         "She IS a kid." 

(She turns to face him) 

Yuffie 
         "Wh, what did you say...!?" 

(She runs up to him.) 

Godo 
         "Yuffie!!" 
         "Forgive me... It's all my fault." 

(Gorky steps forward) 

Gorky 
         "What are you saying, Lord Godo!" 

Godo 
         "Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my 
fault..." 

Chekhov 
         "Lord Godo!" 

Godo 
         "Silence!!" 

(Gorky steps back.) 

Godo 
         "Yuffie......" 

(He looks at the floor.) 

Godo 
         "I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war." 
         "But, after I lost the war, I began to think..." 
         "Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?" 
         "...or just something to show-off to others...?" 
         "Might begets might." 
         "That's the same way as the Shinra..." 

Yuffie 
         "......" 

(Godo turns to face the wall.) 

Godo 
         "I know you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai." 
         "But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of 
Wutai..." 
         "And now, I realize both are necessary..." 
         "Strength without determination means nothing. And determination 
without strength is equally useless...!" 

Staniv 
         "Lord Godo..." 

(Godo trembles a moment, then turns to face Cloud.) 

Godo 
         "You there, please take Yuffie with you!" 
         "I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!" 

Cid 
         "Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the 
rest to ol' Cid!" 

(Cloud shrugs) 

Cloud 
         "All right, I don't mind." 

(Godo points at Yuffie.) 

Godo 
         "Go, Yuffie!" 
         "For the sake of strengthening Wutai!" 

(Yuffie walks up to him.) 

Yuffie 
         "Dad..." 

Godo 
         "I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!" 
         "Go! And come back alive!" 

Yuffie 
         "......" 
         "Of course!" 

(Everyone leaves the room except for Godo. Yuffie is the last to leave.) 

Godo 
         "Yuffie, wait a minute." 

(He runs over to her and whispers in her ear.) 

Godo 
         "The Materia they all have..." 
         "After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?" 

Yuffie 
         "Dad...!" 

Godo 
         "Go! Survive will the end! And return!" 
         "With the Materia!" 

(He thrusts one fist forward) 

Yuffie 
         "Heh, heh... you bet!" 

(She runs downstairs. Godo returns to the front of the room and flexes a 
bit. The scene fades to black.) 








Optional Quests - Vincent

- Meet Vincent - 

(Cloud travels to the Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim. Just inside, he finds a 
letter on the floor.) 

         "I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my 
research. Even that one from the Turks." 
         "I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the 
basement. If you want to find him, then search the area." 
         "But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary to
participate if you don't want to." 
         "There seems to be another letter." 

<CHOICE>

go to the left five steps, up nine steps, left two steps, and up six steps.

         *invisible* 

         The fourth row has been written in invisible ink... Dial (4) is 
(Right 97) 
<//> 

<//> 

(Cloud follows the first hint to a circular room on the second floor. 
There is a treasure chest in the center, and the walls are bordered with 
green plants. He checks the chest.) 

         "Something is written on the back of the lid." 
              (1) Right 36 

(The second clue leads him to the dining room on the first floor. There is 
a grand piano in one corner of the room. He checks behind it.)  

         "Something is written on the floor." 
              (2) Left 10 

(Cloud finds the third number written on the floor in a hallway on the 
second floor.) 

         "Something is written on the floor." 
              (3) Right 59 

(Cloud heads up to the safe in a back room on the second floor and inputs 
the combination. The door opens and a Summon materia pops out - and a boss
monster follows close behind.) 

(Boss battle with Lost Number) 

(Cloud gets a Key to the Basement from the safe, grabs the summon materia 
(Odin), and heads to the basement. He uses the Key to unlock the door 
there, Behind it, he finds a room filled with coffins. All of them are 
open, displaying rotting bodies, save one in the center of the room. Cloud
approaches the one closed coffin.) 

         "...To wake me from the
nightmare" 

(The lid of the coffin flies off to one side, revealing its contents: a 
sleeping man dressed in black and red.) 

         "Who is it!?" 

(He sits up, sleepily) 

         "...Never seen you before. You must leave." 

Cloud 
         "You were having a nightmare." 
  
Tifa 
         "How bad was your dream?"  

         "Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to 
atone." 

Cloud 
         "What are you saying?" 

         "I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out." 
         "This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare." 

(Cloud turns his head down to one side.)

Cloud 
         "...you can say that again." 

         "Hmm? What do you know?" 

<CHOICE> 
         Don't say a thing 
         Talk about Sephiroth 

***Cloud 
         Don't say a thing 

         "I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare..." 

(He lays back down as the coffin lid replaces itself over him.) 

***Cloud 
         Talk about Sephiroth 

Cloud 
         "Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare." 
         "No, it's not a dream, it's for real." 
         "Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this 
mansion..." 

         "Sephiroth!?" 

(He and Cloud speak in unison...) 

         "You know Sephiroth?" 
         "You know Sephiroth?" 

(The man in the coffin rises, does a slow backflip, and lands on the edge 
of the coffin, standing.) 

         "You start first." 

(The screen dims as Cloud tells his story about Sephiroth. The screen 
brightens again) 

Cloud 
         "...That's how it was." 

         "So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the
Jenova Project?" 
         "...He was missing. But he just recently reappeared." 
         "He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land." 

(Cloud makes a "go ahead" gesture with his hand.) 

Cloud 
         "Now it's your turn." 

         "Sorry... I cannot speak." 

Tifa 
         "Hmmm... I'm disappointed." 

(The man hops back down into the coffin.) 

         "Hearing your stories has added upon me yet another sin." 
         "More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously 
had." 

(He lays back down.) 

         "Now... please leave." 

(The coffin lid replaces itself over him.) 

<//> 

(Cloud speaks to the man once more. The coffin lid again flies off and he 
sits up.) 

         "...You're still here." 

<CHOICE> 
         Good night 
         Who are you? 

***Cloud 
         Good night 

(The coffin closes once more.) 

***Cloud 
         Who are you? 

Cloud 
         "At least tell us your name." 

         "I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in 
Adminstrative Research, otherwise known as-- the Turks..." 

(The PLAYER names Vincent) 

         "Vincent." 

Cloud 
         "The Turks!?" 

Vincent 
         "Formerly of the Turks." 
         "I have no affiliation with Shinra now." 
         "...And you?" 

Cloud 
         "Former Shinra soldier, Cloud." 

Vincent 
         "You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?" 

Cloud 
         "Who?" 

Vincent 
         "......Lucrecia." 

(Cloud shakes his head.) 

Vincent 
         "The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth." 

Cloud 
         "...gave birth...?" 
         "Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?" 

Vincent 
         "That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory." 
         "He was born from a beautiful lady." 
         "That lady was Lucrecia." 
         "She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. 
Beautiful... Lucrecia." 

Cloud 
         "...A human experiment?" 

Vincent 
         "There was no way to cancel the experiment." 
         "I couldn't stop her." 
         "That was my sin." 
         "I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst." 

Tifa 
         "So the punishment was sleep? That's weird."  

(Vincent lays back down as the coffin closes once more. Cloud leaves the 
room and heads out of the basement. As he is approaching the stairs back 
to the Shinra mansion, he hears a voice from behind him.) 

Vincent 
         "Wait!" 

(The party turns around as Vincent comes out from his room.) 

Vincent 
         "If I go with you will I meet Hojo?" 

(Cloud shrugs.) 

Cloud 
         "Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or 
later..." 

(Vincent turns away from them) 

Vincent 
         "Lucrecia..." 

(He turns back) 

Vincent 
         "All right. I've decided to go with you." 

Tifa 
         "What? You're coming with us?" 

Vincent 
         "Being a former Turk, I may be of help to you..." 

Cloud 
         "All right, then." 

(Cloud reassembles his party and leaves the Shinra mansion.) 
  
  
  





  - Waterfall Cave - 

(At some point before the Midgar raid, Cloud (with Vincent in his party) 
takes the submarine down through an underwater cave, reaching an enclosed
lake with a waterfall filling it. He finds a hidden cave behind the 
waterfall. Inside, the cave floor is shiny blue stone, the walls angular, 
the room a perfect circle- obviously manmade. As he enters, he hears a 
voice.) 

         Vincent... 

(Vincent runs forward.) 

Vincent 
         "That voice? It can't be..." 

(He takes a few steps forward. As the camera follows him, we see a soft 
white light at the other side of the cave. There is the form of a woman 
kneeling inside it.) 

Vincent 
         "Lucrecia...?" 

(The woman stands and turns to Vincent.) 

         "Vincent......?" 

Vincent 
         "Lucrecia!" 

(Vincent runs toward her.) 

         "Stay back!" 

(The woman puts out her hand to stay him. The screen fades to white. As 
the white fades, the scene is shifted to Nibelheim. There are three 
scientists in laboratory coats walking toward the Shinra mansion: Hojo, 
Gast, and Lucrecia, followed by a man in Turks uniform: Vincent. As the 
scientists enter, Vincent stops at the gate. The scene fades to the 
courtyard in Nibelheim. Vincent and Lucrecia are walking through town, 
arm in arm. The scene fades to the front gate. Vincent is handing a small 
item to Lucrecia, most likely a wedding ring. Lucrecia stares at it, then 
shakes her head, starts to cry, and runs off. Vincent can only stand and 
watch her go. The scene fades a moment, then we see Hojo and Lucrecia at 
the gate, kissing, oblivious to the world. Vincent arrives, stares 
blankly a moment, then turns in disgust and leaves. The screen fades to 
black.) 

         If she is happy then... I don't mind. 
                                                   
(The scene fades in to the top floor of the Nibelheim inn. Lucrecia is 
seated at the table there, head in her hands. The scene fades to the 
laboratory in the basement of the Shinra mansion. Hojo and Lucrecia stand 
nest to each other on one side of the room, Vincent opposed on the other.) 

Vincent 
         "I'm against it! Why experiments on humans!?" 

Hojo 
         "She and I are both scientists!!" 

(The screen fades to black.) 

         After that, a child was born to Lucrecia... 
         That child's name is... 
         Sephiroth... 

(The scene fades back to the upper floor at the inn. Lucrecia walks 
across the room towards the table. Halfway through her journey, she stops 
and falls to the floor, fainted. The scene fades back to the laboratory. 
Vincent and Hojo stand facing each other, having a heated discussion we 
cannot hear. Hojo begins to clutch at his hair in fury, then pulls a gun 
from his lab coat and shoots Vincent in the stomach. He falls to his knees, 
staring up at Hojo, then face down to the floor. The scene fades black a 
moment, then Vincent is unconscious on the operating table in the lab. 
Hojo stands over him, working some experiment. The scene fades a moment 
and then Hojo is gone, Vincent alone on the table. He comes to, swings 
his legs over the side and stands. He looks blankly at his left hand, 
then raises both fists skyward, trembling. The screen fades to black.) 

         Urrrrrrrrgh!! 

Vincent 
         "This body is... the punishment that's been given to me..." 
         "I was unable...... to stop Professor Gast and Hojo..." 
         "And Lucrecia... I was unable to stop them..." 
         "All that I was able to do was watch... That is my punishment..." 

(The scene fades back in to the hidden cave behind the waterfall. Vincent 
has fallen back away from Lucrecia, who is now kneeling again inside the 
soft white glow.) 

Vincent 
         "Lucrecia... You're alive..." 

Lucrecia 
         "I wanted to disappear... I couldn't be with anyone... I wanted 
to die..." 
         "But the Jenova inside me wouldn't let me die..." 

(She shakes her head.) 

Lucrecia 
         "Lately, I dream a lot of Sephiroth... My dear, dear child." 
         "Ever since he was born I never got to hold him, even once..." 
         "Not even once. You can't call me his mother... That... is my 
sin..." 

(Vincent steps forward. She rises up on her knees.) 

Lucrecia 
         "Back!! Stay back!" 

(He stops. She settles back down.) 

Lucrecia 
         "Vincent... Won't you please tell me?" 

Vincent 
         "......What?" 

Lucrecia 
         "If Sephiroth is still alive?" 
         "I heard that he died five years ago. But I see him in my dreams 
so often..." 
         "And I know that physically, like myself, he can't die so easily." 
         "Please, Vincent, tell me......" 

(Cloud comes forward to Vincent, but he waves him back.) 

Vincent 
         "Lucrecia... Sephiroth is dead..." 

(The screen fades to black.) 
  







  - Gift From Lucrecia -

(After defeating Hojo, Cloud and Vincent return to the waterfall cave. A 
bright light is shining where Lucrecia had stood before. As the party 
approaches, Vincent runs ahead and stands before the light.) 

Vincent 
 "Lucrecia........" 

(Vincent receives the Death Penalty and "Chaos" Limit Break.) 








Optional Quests - Basement Flashback

- Laboratory Revelations - 

(Cloud travels back to the Shinra Mansion. He heads downstairs to the 
basement. Upon entering the laboratory, the scene fades to black and a 
pounding heartbeat begins to sound. The scene fades in to show the two 
vertical glass tubes in the basement, now glowing green light. In one tube 
floats Zack, in the other, Cloud. The camera shifts to show the entire 
lab again. A man in a gray suit arrives, carrying a plate.) 

         "Hey! This is your food."

(He places the plate on the table in front of the tubes. He opens up 
Zack's tube, planning to give him his supper, to be greeted by one of 
Zack's fists. As he goes down, Zack leaps out of his tube and opens 
Cloud's. The tube comes open with a hiss of escaping steam, steam which 
Zack's tube didn't emit. The camera moves to show Cloud tumble forward out 
of the tube, landing on his hands and knees. He seems to have trouble 
supporting his head as it bobs up and down like a children's toy. Behind 
him, Zack retrieves his sword from offscreen and holds it skyward. He 
looks down to see Cloud still collapsed on the floor and walks over to 
help him up. The camera shifts to the gates of Nibelheim as Zack 
practically drags the ever-uncooperative and malformed Cloud out of 
Nibelheim. The scene fades to black.) 

Zack 
         "Oh, here!!" 
         "Put on this." 

(We hear sounds of clothes being put on.) 

Zack 
         "It smells a little though don't complain." 

(Slapping sounds.) 

Zack 
         "You look pretty good with that." 
         "Well......" 

(The scene fades in. Zack and Cloud are in the back of an old, 
no-longer-white pickup truck driven by a farmer in a white suit. Cloud is 
leaned against the tailgate, head still bobbing, while Zack is up and 
around. He walks up and bangs on the rear window of the cab.) 

Zack 
         "Yo! Old guy! We at Midgar yet?"

(The driver looks up at Zack in the rearview mirror.) 

         "Shaddap! You're lucky I even gave you a ride!" 

(Zack surveys the passing scenery a moment and then sits down next to 
Cloud.) 

Zack 
         "What're you gonna do when we get to Midgar?" 

(Cloud continues to bob his head.) 

Cloud 
         "........." 

(Zack stands) 

Zack 
         "I know what I'm gonna do." 

(He crosses his arms) 

Zack 
         "I got a place I can crash for a while..." 

(He turns to Cloud) 

Zack 
         "No wait, the mother lives there, too..." 

(He scratches his head.) 

Zack 
         "Guess that's out..." 

(He shakes his head. Cloud continues to bob his like nobody's business.) 

Cloud 
         "........." 

Zack 
         "Yep... gotta change my plans!" 
         "Hmm......" 
         "No matter what I do, I need some money first..." 
         "...Hey, wanna start a business? But what could we do?" 

(He thinks a moment.) 

Zack 
         "Hey, Cloud." 
         "Think there's anything I'd be good at?" 

(Bob bob. Zack turns to the driver.) 

Zack 
         "Hey old guy!" 
         "What do you think I'd be good at?" 

         "What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya?" 
         "Young folks should try everything!" 
         "You gotta pay your debts while you're young." 
         "Go out and look for what you really want." 

(Zack turns back to Cloud.) 

Zack 
         "Try everything... That's easy for him to say..." 

(He does squat-thrusts for a few minutes as Cloud continues his 
head-bobbing.) 

Zack 
         "HEY!" 

(He turns to Cloud) 

Zack 
         "Of course!" 
         "I got a lot of brains a skill that other guys don't!" 
         "That settles it!" 
         "I'm gonna become a mercenary!" 

(He turns to the driver) 

Zack 
         "Yeah! Thanks pops!" 

         "Hey... didn't you even hear a word I said?" 

(He turns back to Cloud) 

Zack 
         "Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that." 
         "Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money." 
         "I'm gonna be rich!" 

(The driver shakes his head.)

Zack 
         "So, Cloud? What are YOU gonna do?" 

         "No, wait... you got it all wrong." 

Cloud 
         "u... uhhh......" 

Zack 
         "Just kidding... I won't leave you hanging like that." 

(He sits down next to Cloud.)

Zack 
         "We're friends, right?" 

(He leans his head over to Cloud's. Cloud stops his bobbing momentarily.) 

Zack 
         "Mercenaries, Cloud. That's what you an' me are gonna be." 

(He stands) 

Zack 
         "Understand, Cloud?" 

(He nods. The scene fades to black. It fades in again on a cliff in the 
mountains above Midgar. The ground is solid rock save a few patches of 
moss here and there. Zack enters, dragging Cloud along behind him.  He 
makes it about halfway to the edge of the cliff when he hears shooting 
behind him. He drops Cloud, who lays face down on the ground like a rag 
doll. Zack unsheathes his sword as the shooting comes closer and closer, 
then runs offscreen in the direction of the noise. He comes back a moment 
later, leans down and touches Cloud to check on him, when a bullet strikes 
him square in the chest. He flies backwards and lands near the edge of the 
cliff. Two Shinra soldiers and a captain come running past Cloud and gather 
around Zack, who is struggling to get up. They aim their guns and shoot 
him several times in his head, point-blank. One soldier goes over and aims 
his gun at Cloud, still motionless. He looks over his shoulder at the 
captain.)

Shinra Soldier 
         "What do you want me to do with him?" 

Cloud 
         "...Ah... ughhhh......" 

(The captain comes over and inspects Cloud.) 

Commander 
         "...Forget it. Just leave him."

(He leaves. The other two soldiers follow. It begins to rain lightly. A 
few moments after they are gone, Cloud pulls himself up on his hands and 
begins to slowly drag the rest of his body up towards Zack's body. He 
sits up on his knees and picks up Zack's sword, still lying across his 
body. Cloud inspects it stupidly for a moment, then lifts it toward the 
sky, trembling under its weight, as the camera pans up to show the city of 
Midgar beneath the overcast sky. The screen fades to black.) 








Optional Quests - Red XIII

- Strength of the Valley -

(Cloud and Red XIII return to Cosmo Canyon. As they approach the gate, 
the doorman turns to greet them.) 

         "Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from 
that last trip, he doesn't seem well." 
         "Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?" 

(They hurry to Bugenhagen's observatory.) 

Red XIII 
         "Grandfather!!" 

(He bounds up the stairs in search of Bugenhagen. Cid starts to follow, 
but Cloud calls him back, shaking his head. Cid nods and the two leave. 
The camera pans upward to show Bugenhagen's second-floor bedroom. 
Bugenhagen is lying on his old green couch, Red XIII by his side.)

Red XIII 
         "Grandfather!!" 

(Bugenhagen raises one arm.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "...Nanaki...? ...you're still......
here?" 

(He lowers it. Red XIII shakes his head.)

Red XIII 
         "I can't leave you like this, grandfather...!" 
         "It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her 
people..." 

Bugenhagen 
         "...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know." 
         "If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this 
valley." 
         "Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of 
the newborn chocobos." 
         "Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater 
than the span of a human life." 
         "It will teach you more than staying here in the valley..." 
         "What you see will eventually become a part of life's dream." 
         "For my children...... And for your children......" 

(He lifts one hand.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes... your 
ears..." 

(It falls. Red XIII lowers his head.) 

Red XIII 
         "............" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho...... Hooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all 
right." 
         "It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even 
find your life's mate. You never know."

Red XIII 
         "Grandfather......" 

Bugenhagen 
         "Oh yes... take this along. I think it will look good on you now." 

(He lifts one arm to hand Red XIII a new comb.) 

Bugenhagen 
         "Ho Ho......" 

(His arm falls to the floor. Red XIII leaps up and begins to frantically 
nudge Bugenhagen's body. The scene fades to black.) 
  
  
(Cloud and Cid are sitting by the Cosmo
Candle when Red XIII walks slowly
onto the small ledge and sits by the
flame. The others stand.) 

Cloud 
         "Red XIII... Is Bugenhagen...?" 

(Red XIII half-stands.) 

Red XIII 
         "......" 
         "Grandpa told me that he's going away again!" 

Cloud 
         "Away...?" 

(Red XIII sits again.) 

Red XIII 
         "It seems like he really liked that Airship." 
         "He told me he couldn't stay and just zipped out of here!" 
         "He even gave me a gift, look!" 

(He displays his comb, the Limited Moon.) 

Red XIII 
         "Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you 
come back?" 
         "Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange! Haa... ha ha...... ha......" 

(He shakes his head.) 

Cloud 
         "Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somwhere." 

(Red XIII nods weakly) 

Red XIII 
         "Yeah... maybe..." 
         "Thanks, Cloud......" 

(The three leave Cosmo Canyon.) 








Optional Quests - Zangan's Letter

- Zangan's Letter -

(Cloud travels to Nibelheim and enters Tifa's house. He goes up the 
stairs to her room and walks to the piano.) 

Cloud 
         "Play the piano......?" 

<CHOICE> 
         No, forget it 
         Aw, go for it 

***Cloud 
         No, forget it 

***Cloud 
         Aw, go for it 

Cloud 
         "Now, how did this go?" 

<CHOICE> 
         I forgot 
         I remember 

***Cloud 
         I forgot 

(Cloud receives a tutorial on playing the piano.) 

***Cloud 
         I remember 

(He plays the piano. He plays the sequence "Do Re Mi Ti La Do Re Mi So Fa 
Do Re Do." The main theme of Final Fantasy VII.) 

Cloud 
         "I wonder what... this is..." 

(Tifa's secret savings of 1 gil comes out of the keyboard.) 

Cloud 
         "I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well..." 

Tifa 
         "I have the sheet music for that song." 
         "Huh? Wait a minute! There's something inside the music sheet." 

(The screen fades almost black and Tifa discovers a letter hidden in the 
sheet music.) 

<//> 

<//> 

         "Tifa, what's happened to our town? Was it all an illusion, or 
just a dream? No, it was neither. I remember trying to get people out of 
the flames, but not having the strength... Burning with anger, I went to 
the reactor to kill Sephiroth." 
         "But he was nowhere to be found. Instead, I found you, collapsed 
inside. I felt saving you was far more important than going after 
Sephiroth. There were several others that were still alive inside, but I 
was only able to save you." 
         "As I was coming out of the reactor, Shinra troops were just 
arriving. I recall a scientist named Hojo was in charge. He ordered the 
troops to gather up everyone still alive for the experiment. I didn't know 
what type of experiment he was talking about, but I wasn't about to let 
them have my dearest student." 
         "Putting you on my back, I headed down the mountain to the 
village. I used the Cure spell on you many times." 
         "And started to head for Midgar to look for a doctor for you. I 
don't like that city, but my Cure spells weren't helping." 
         "I decided to go to Midgar to find a doctor I could trust. I'm 
worried about you, but I can't settle down in one place for very long. 
Have you recovered fully? Are you well?" 
         "I wonder how many years have passed since then? I just got into 
town again, but I can't believe it... The whole town is back to normal, 
except for the strange beings with black clothes all around..." 
         "The town reeks of Shinra, but I won't go after them. You may 
think I'm running from them, but it's just that I don't want anything to 
do with Shinra anymore. Feels like time is running out." 
         "I'm sure you'll find this letter. And this gift for you. It 
should come in handy. I can't even jump anymore. But I hope you continue 
to sharpen your skills and remember what I taught you." 
         "To my most precious student, From Zangan" 

(Tifa receives the Final Heaven. She leaps over Cloud and practices her 
best fighting moves, then nods and leaps over Cloud again. The party 
leaves Nibelheim.)
