C'mon newcomer. Follow me.
Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! ...Not
everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE.
SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?
What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?
Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER.
He quit them and now is one of us.
Didn't catch your name...
...Cloud.
Cloud, eh? I'm...
I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over... I'm 
outta here.
The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a 
group!
Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge 
in front of it.
Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!
If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL] 
button to run. (earlier marked X)
I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the
mission, Cloud.
Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace
up? This'll be somethin' to see!
Yo! This your first time in a reactor?
No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know.
The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it
every day.
It's the life blood of the planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the 
blood out with these machines.
I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry.
That's it! You're comin' with me from now on.
Biggs and I got the code for this door.
Code deciphered
Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this 
code...
Code deciphered
Push that button over there!
Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And 
that'll be that.
It's not my problem.
The planet's dyin', Cloud!
The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before 
security and the Roboguards come.
Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it.
After that, use the [Directional button] to move up and down.
When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more
than a hunka junk.
Cloud, you set the bomb.
Shouldn't you do it?
Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.
Fine, be my guest.
...What's wrong?
Huh?
What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!
Yeah, sorry.
Heads up, here they come!
Come on, let's get outta here!
You all right?
My leg got stuck.
Thanks!
Let's go!
Code deciphered
Alright, be careful.
Code deciphered
That should keep the planet going... at least a little longer.
Yeah.
.........
OK! Now everyone get back.
All right, now let's get out of here.
Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!
H, hey!
If it's about your money save it 'til we're back at the hideout.
Excuse me.
What happened?
.........
Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil....?
Oh, thank you!
Here you are!
Just what the hell's going on!?
Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see...
Hey! You there!
Shinra soldiers...
That's as far as you go.
I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys.
Enough babbling! Grab him!
Cloud never came.
Cloud... Wonder if he was killed?
No way!!
Cloud...
Say, do you think Cloud's...
Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?
The hell would I know? Do I look like a mind reader?
Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups...
Hey Barret! What about our money...?
Uh, nothin'... sorry.
Ahh.......
Cloud!!
Cloud...
Cloud!!
Looks like I'm a little late.
You damn right, you're late!!
Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!
It's no big deal. Just what I always do.
Shi't!
Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no 
one but yourself!
Hmm..... You were worried about me!
Wha!?
I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff!
Wake up!
We're movin' out! Follow me!
Hey, Cloud! You were great back there!
Heh heh.... Cloud! We'll do even better next time.
Be careful, I'll shut this.
Oh, Cloud! Your face is pitch-black.....
There you go!
Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor!
This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy...
Huh? This is my house, so make yourselves at home.
You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?
The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere 
in the slums.
...blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this 
one.
They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll 
do next?
Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!
Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous ...and me, too!
It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet.
I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.
Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?
It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it
together. I'll explain it to you.
I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know,
flashy stuff.
Okay, it's about to start.
This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.
It's about a 1/10000 scale.
The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.
A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and 
there are other support structures built in each section...
psst... whisper... whisper... (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was 
in the northern section.)
Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.
The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.
Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers 
them.
Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's 
the kind of place this is.
Phew..., this is next! Look.
This is the route the train is on.
The route spirals around the main support structure.
We should be coming around the center area, right now.
At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up.
It can check the identities and background on each and every 
passenger on the train by linking it up to the central databank at Shinra 
headquarters.
whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look 
suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)
Speak of the devil...
That light means we're in the ID Security Check area.
whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know 
what kind of creeps'll come out.)
...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief.
...snore.... heebeebeeheebee... snore... (Don't act so damn big, 
Barret... snooze...)
Look... you can see the surface now. This city don't have no 
day or night.
If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky.
A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery.
Huh?
Never expect to hear that outta someone like you.
...you jes' full of surprises.
The upper world... a city on a plate...
It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza', that people underneath are 
sufferin'!
And the city below is full of polluted air.
On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.
Then why doesn't everyone move onto the plate?
Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe...
'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets.
I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to.
It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its 
rails take it.
Yo!! Get over here, all' ya!!
This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.
The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that 
explosion!
'Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!
Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
I'm not letting you go tonight.
Wow!
Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?
There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say 
there's ghosts around too!
...damn.
What?
Hey now! ...Oops!
What on earth are you doing? Just butt out... geez!
Huh? You come to see it, too?
There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, 
everyone in the slums is dust...
Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.
Hey! Look! It's huge, ain't it?
Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place.
This is my place, but you can come here when you want.
Bye, bro!
Yo. Cloud! Over here, now!
Ok! Go on ahead.
Yo! Cloud!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!
Papa!
Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?
Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well.
Did you fight with Barret?
I should have known.
He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in 
fights ever since you were little.
I was worried.
Hmm. You've grown up.
When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of 
a hat.
Flowers? How nice...
You almost never see them here in the slums.
But...
A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have...
No big.
Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful.
Maybe I should fill the store with flowers.
Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy.
............
Oh. Cloud!
Tifa realls knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm.......
Anyway, let me tell you somethin'.
Tifa always lets me taste her cooking.
And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly.
Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good 
food and drinks that make this shop famous.
Cloud...... ........forget it.
Careless..... You're getting all excited.
Wonder what for.....?
Aah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job.
Hic!!
Why don't you have one too?
What!? you tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?
Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!
Oh!! That's more like it!
Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So 
you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!
Hic...!!
Oh..... Don't tell Barret what I jus said.
Papa, welcome home!
Yeah.
Huh? Where'd you get that flower?
Cloud gave it to me.
Oh....
Did you thank him?
..........
Thank you, Cloud.
We'll take care of you.
You all right, Barret?
Great!!
Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!
Sit down.
How about...
...something to drink?
Just a minute. I'll make one for you.
You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely.
What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job.
I guess not...
You were in SOLDIER.
Make sure you get your pay from Barret.
Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here.
OHH!!
I can make a drink just as good as anyone else.
Everyone says, my drinks taste the best!
Cloud, are you feeling all right?
...yeah... Why?
No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.
You'd better go down below.
You think I'm a litte too uptight?
The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor.
Cloud, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?
Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be 
it.
Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, 
but I'm a coward at heart.
Oops...
Hey, look at the news... What a blast.
Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was 
just make it like the computer told me.
Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.
Yo. Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya.
Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?
None. I'm positive.
You sound pretty sure.
If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here 
now.
Don't go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.
.......
Yeah, you're strong.
Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are.
But don't forget your skinny ass's working for AVALANCHE now!
Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra.
Stayin' with Shinra?
You asked me a question and I answered it... that's all.
I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.
Shucks!! ........money....
Papa. you're so great!
Wait, Cloud!
Tifa! Let him go!
Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
Shut up!
I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER!
But don't get me wrong!
I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!
Straighten things up with everyone for me.
...Cloud.
You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me.
Cloud.... you just want friends.
Isn't that right?
Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me.
If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can 
always talk to me.
You're terrible. Real cold blooded.
Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us.
Sorry Tifa...
The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying.
Someone has to do something.
So let Barret and his buddies do something about it.
It's got nothin' to do with me.
So! You're really leaving!?
You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood 
friend!?
What......?
You forgot the promise, too.
Promise?
So you DID forget.
Remember.... Cloud. It was seven years ago...
Look, the well.
Do you remember?
Yeah.... back then.
I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little
cold.
Sorry I'm late.
You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
Come this spring.... I'm leaving this town for Midgar.
........All boys are leaving our town.
But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a 
job.
I want to join SOLDIER.
I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth.
Sephiroth.... The Great Sephiroth.
Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
...I probably wont be able to come back to this town for a
while.
...huh?
Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?
I'll try.
Hey, why don't we make a promise?
Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind.....
You come save me, all right?
What?
Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me.
I want to at least experience that once.
What?
Come on--! Promise me----!
All right.... I promise.
You remember now? ...Our promise?
I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep.... the promise.
But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER.
So come on! You've got to keep your promise......
Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!
A promise is a promise! Here!!
This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.
What? Then you'll...!!
You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.
What....!?
It's ok, it's ok.
psst, psst..... (We're realy hurting for help, right?)
Uh..... ugh..... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)
2000!
Thanks, Cloud.
Good Morning! Cloud!
Did you sleep well?
psstpsst...
(keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an 
operation.)
I don't know what you mean.
I'm going this time.
Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first.
I'll fill you in on the train.
Yo! Cloud!
Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!
I, uh,..... I don't really know how to use Materia!
I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use 
it!
...sigh...
Shi....! What's this 'It wasn't that tough' crap!
I'm clueless......
Well, you handle the Materia then!
So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?
Ok, I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the 
Materia!
Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs.
He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!
Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!
All right! Good Luck.
I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better 
man! This is goodbye!
Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of Tifa!
Ah... Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed.
I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when
I'm not drinking.
I hope he doesn't get hurt.
That worries me the most.
Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you
from outside the bar.
Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one!
Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!
He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was
here, but now that he's gone.... I kind of miss him.
......strange, isn't it?
Ha! Ha!..... I wonder if my son's already left?
When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome 
it gets.
Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of 
getting gossip on everyone?
Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!
I'll get a little more information that would pique even your 
interest. You wait and see!
You dried up old geez. You tired?
Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house?
There's just one condition.
You gotta give me some cash.
Damn, man!! Just forget about it!
Oh man, oh man...
Go ahead and help yourself to the room.
Use whatever bed you want. Sleep tight, old guy.
Cheap %#*^......
This is a slum, so don't 
think you can stay for free.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?
Sweet dreams, pops.
Tough guy, huh!? You better sleep when you
can.
You'd better save when you can.
That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude.
This is the Beginner's Hall.
You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you
how much I know.... an' for free too!
All
Hey! You got one right off!
That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!
This is the fabled [Save Point]!!
At a [Save Pont] you can use a [tent] and/or select *SAVE*.
There's more, too. Look for something called secret.
Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that 
same point.
That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.
This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar...
Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. 
Remember that.
You've got to hang in there. Your limit gauge is just starting 
to build.
Waaah!
OK! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight 
with your limit techinique.
Great!
Magic! Magic!
Help!
Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic 
Barrier] or [reflect].
[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage recieved from magic by half.
[Reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times 
you can use it is limited so be careful.
Great!
Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too!
Me too!
If you want to get as stong as me you need to use Materia.
And you have to find the best combinations of them.
The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will 
determine how quickly your Materia grows.
Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The 
possible combinations are limitless.
That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you 
have to have some natural talent.
I still don't get it!
Listen kid, don't piss me off!
That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll 
get used to it.
Hey SOLDIER! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!
I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But 
I'll rap with you for a while.
Heh heh... He'll forget about it. OH, you!
Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya.
He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!
You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'....
Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean.
Ahh... Another slow day...
If this keeps up, this store's goin' under....
Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this.
Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. You a....... 
customer?
Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!
I've had it!
Me too.
You know this is the first time we've ever agreed on something.
Yes...
Well then, shall we.....?
Yes......
YO!
Looks like this ain't no private car! So split up!
....hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck...
You say sumthin'?
I said, 'you say sumthin'!?
Yo, look at that! It got empty alluva sudden.
What's goin' on?
DAMN!
I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you...
Y, Y, YIPES!!
You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be 
more bombings.
Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like 
today.
You workin' for Shinra?
I won't give in to violence...
Barret!!
&$#%!! You lucky ^$#$,!
So, what are we going to do now?
Shit! the hell you so calm about? you bustin up my rhythm...
Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally 
leaving.
So what's our next target?
Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!
Awright.... I'll tell ya!
Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security
check point at the top plate.
It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.
Which Shinra is very proud of.
We can't use our fake ID's anymore...
That means we've only got three more minutes to the ID Check 
point.
Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.
Got it!?
Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.
Hmm....? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my 
house.
I'm impressed.
Waaaaah!!
Don... don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...!! I'm 
gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)
Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already...
It's all right. Come a little closer.
That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
What's happening?
What's goin' on!!
We're in trouble.
I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
^%#@%! Someone blew it...
Let's go! Keep it up!
Hurry!
They're gonna lock the door, sir!
Just run!
Changing to Plan 2!
Gosh! You're adults but you're making such noise!
Please behave while on the train!
Does this mean we're in a major bind?
Awright! We clear!?
Not yet. They're starting another search. If we're caught, we're 
done for!
But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should 
get past it!
Hee hee!
Later... goodbye... adios, Midgar!
All right!! We made it!
Yo! This way!!
Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!
Scary... huh.
Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?
Because...
Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!
It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud?
Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?
You look great, just like a man.
Yay!! I'm so happy.... I think?
Just concentrate on our plan.
You're right, sorry.
Yeah!! I've made up my mind.
Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!
You don't care if I go first?
A leader always stays till the end.
Don't worry 'bout me, just go!
Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!
It's only the beginnin' of the mission!
Later! You take care of the rest!
Good, so far everything's going as planned.
Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 
reactor.
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.
Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!
Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go 
any further.
That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that 
to get under the Plate? No way!
Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?
There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct.
Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up 
here.
Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.
Cloud, you jes' gotta go.
But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills.
Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way
of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.
I'm sorry.
The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.
I made your ID card special... So that's why it happened.
I put my heart into making it. But I failed.
Next time, I'll give you something more decent.
I'll be back at the hideout in the research room workin' on it.
We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.
Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!
Papa...
Sephiroth!?
Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?
Sephiroth.... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!
I hate them all!
Damn man, get a hold of yourself!
You all right?
......Tifa.
Mmm?
No... forget...... Come on, let's hurry!
Jessie said we all have to the buttons at once.
This way!
Shinra soldiers!?
SHIT! What the hell's goin' on?
...a trap...
President Shinra?
Why is the President here?
Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?
AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, 
huh?
Long time no see, President.
...Long time no see? Oh... you.
You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew 
you were exposed to Mako, from the glow in your eyes...
Tell me, traitor... what was your name?
Cloud.
Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each 
person's name.
Unless you become another Sephiroth.
Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant...
Sephiroth.....?
Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place'e goin' up with 
a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin 
like you...
VERMIN? That's all you can say... VERMIN!
Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes 
you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!
...You are beginning to bore me.
I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner 
I must attend.
Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all.
!? What's that noise?
The hell is this!?
Meet 'Airbuster,' a techno-soldier,. Our Weapon Development 
Department created him.
I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be
of great use to us in future experiments.
...Techno-soldier?
Now then, if you'll excuse me.
Wait, President!
Yo, Cloud! We've gotta do somethin' about him!
Help, Cloud!
THIS is from SOLDIER?
No way! It's just a machine.
I don't care what it is! I'm gonna bust him up!
It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!
Barret! Can't you do something?
Not a damn thing.
Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much
I want to tell you!
I know, Tifa......
Hey, you gonna be awright?
..........
You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of Tifa!
...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
Stop talkin' like this is the end!
Shit! Can't hold on much longer. Barret..... Hurry!
Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for 
ya. Ya gotta do it yourself.
Barret...
Alright, then, later.
.....Yeah.....
What do you mean by 'back then'?
.....What do you mean by 'that time'? .....What about now?
.....I'll give it a try.
Oh! He moved!
Hello, hello?
.....I know.
Hey... who are you?
Hello, hello!
You okay?
This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.
You suddenly fell on top of me. You really gave me quite a
scare.
......I came crashing down?
The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall.
You're lucky.
Flower bed... is this yours?
Sorry about that.
That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because 
this is a sacred place.
They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar.
But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here.
I love it here.
.....So, we meet again.
Don't you remember me?
Yeah, I remember...
Oh, I'm so happy!
Thanks for buying my flowers.
Excuse me, but that's really rude!
But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.
.....I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.
But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.
Say, do you have any materia?
Yes, some.
Nowadays you can find materia anywhere.
But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.
.....good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use 
it.
No, I do... it just doesn't do anything.
I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's....
Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?
After all, here we are meeting again, right?
Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll be just a minute.
....oh, I see.
Ahhh, I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, 
you know. Poor flowers.
Just a little longer.
Oh!
Now that you mention it.....
We don't know each other's names, do we?
My name is....
I'm Aerith, the flower girl. Nice to meet you.
The name's Cloud.
Me.....? I do a little bit of everything.
Oh.... a jack of all trades.
Yeah, I do whatever's needed.
What's so funny? What are you laughing at?
Sorry..... I just...
Sorry, bad timing on my part.
Cloud! Don't let it get to you!
Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?
You DO do everything, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Then, get me out of here. Take me home.
OK, I'll do it... but it'll cost you.
Well then, let's see......
How about if I go out with you once?
I don't know who you are, but....
You don't know me.....?
Oh yeah...... I know you.
That uniform....
.....Hey, sis, this one's a little weird.
Shut up! You Shinra spy!
Reno! Want him taken out?
I haven't decided yet.
Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!
The exit is back there.
They were..... Mako eyes.
Yeah, all right. Back to work,
back to work.
Oh!
And don't step on the
flowers......
Hey Reno, you just stepped on them!
They're all ruined!
You're gonna catch holy hell!
There they are, over there!
Cloud... that one!
I know... Looks like they aren't
going to let us go.
What should we do?
Well we can't let them catch us,
can we? Then, there's only one thing left.
Aerith! This way!
All right. I'll hold them off.
Right. Make sure they don't get through!
The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! Attack!
Eaygh!!
Aerith!
Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say!
Cloud, help!
Damn!
What's that...?
Thanks, Cloud.
Aerith, this way.
Ha, ha..... They're looking for me again.
You mean it's not the first time
they've been after you?
...no.
They're the Turks.
Hmmm......
The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible 
candidates for SOLDIER.
This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.
They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side.
Spying, murder... you know.
They look like it.
But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?
No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be 
in SOLDIER!
Maybe you do. You want to join?
I don't know... But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!
Then, let's go!
Wait... Wait, I said!
Puff... wheeze...
Slow.... down.... Don't leave me....
Funny...
I thought you were cut out to be
in SOLDIER?
Oh! You're terrible!
Hey.... Cloud. Were you ever in
SOLDIER?
.....
...I used to be. How did you guess?
...Your eyes. They have a strange glow...
That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako...
A mark of SOLDIER.
But, how did you know about that?
........Oh, nothing.
Nothing....?
Right, nothing!
Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!
Whew! Finally made it off! Now what...
My house is over here. Let's
hurry before they get here!
I'm home, mom.
This is Cloud, my bodyguard.
Bodyguard.....? You mean you were followed again!?
Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?
I'm all right. I had Cloud with me.
Thank you, Cloud.
So, what are you going to do now?
...Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to Tifa's bar.
Is Tifa...... a girl?
Yeah.
A girl... friend?
Girlfriend?
Hee hee hee....
You don't have to get THAT upset...
Oh, how nice.
Well, that's... nice.
Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you
the way.
You gotta be kidding. Why do
you want to put yourself in danger
again?
I'm used to it.
Used to it!?
....Well, don't know... getting
help from a girl...
A girl!! What do you mean by that!?
You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say 
something like that!?
Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.
But dear... I give up. You never listen once you've made up your 
mind.
But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late 
now.
Yeah, you're right, mom.
Aerith, please go and make the bed.
That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?
Yeah. Rather I used to be...
.... I don't know how to say this, but...
Would you please leave here, tonight?
Without telling Aerith.
You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is 
a little
dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.
Cloud....
Good night.
Oh, man...
...seem pretty tired......
.......!?
I haven't slept in a bed like this ....in a long time.
....Oh, yeah.
Ever since that time.
My, how you've grown.
I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.
...Not really.
...I'm worried about you.
There are a lot of temptations in
the city...
I'd feel a lot better if you just
settled down and had a nice girlfriend.
...I'm all right.
You should have...
an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.
I think that would be the perfect type for you.
I'm not interested.
...I must've fallen asleep.
Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself...
Take care of yourself. It's the law of the slums. But to do 
that, first, you need weapons, right?
Hmph.....! Everything President Shinra says is a lie.
But then again, you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you 
call them.
You can bat it around all you like. But in the end it comes 
down to wanting to be like those who live up above.
So who do you believe in? Oneself! Me! I never lie to myself, 
that's for sure!
And now for the news.
Due to a terrorist attack by the group named AVALANCHE, parts of 
Midgar that were temporarily out of power will be restored momentarily.
Following President Shinra's lead, Mayor Domino also spoke out 
public against AVALANCHE.
glug... glug...
Now... no one... will find it... num...
The top one... and the bottom one...
...stare... hmph... we only trade items for gil here.
I don't care if it's scrap metal or materia. We can get anything 
here in the slums.
Got a lot of good materia here. Why don't you look it over?
ooh.... aaah..... aghhhh....
You're up bright and early.
How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be 
dangerous?
Are you done?
You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th 
Heaven.
I'll take you there. Come on!
The gate to Sector 7's in there.
Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going 
home?
Oh no! 'Whatever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to 
say?
Isn't that a little out of the way?
Yeah, I guess so.
I could do that. But won't I be in your way?
What do you mean in the way?
Nothing!
Can we take a break?
I can't believe it's still here.
Cloud, get over here!
What rank were you?
Rank?
You know, in SOLDIER.
Oh, I was...
First Class.
Just the same as him.
The same as who?
My first boyfriend.
You were... serious?
No. But I liked him for a while.
I probably knew him. What was his name?
It doesn't really matter.
Huh? Hey, back there.....
Tifa!?
That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked 
kind of odd...
Wait!
I'll go on alone! You go home!
This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So 
we've got to find Tifa fast.
I just can't make up my mind. Mmm.
Huh? About what?
Hmmm, don't make me say it. It's the shop down on the right.
Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?
We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?
Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?
Hey boy! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there!
Take her to Don's place, and you'll make a mint.
Whoa!
Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?
Please come in. Here's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter 
now.
Welcome! Sit wherever you like!
I'm gonna get another Pharmacy Coupon today.
umf... scarf... glub...
I always get the Special.
It's thanks to the Don that we can eat like this.
umf... grunt... smack... Don't sneak up on me like that!
It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.
...We're closed now.
Oh... what should I do... Should I just buy it......?
Welcome. Please take your time.
Don't push! Hooligan!
All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?
All this, belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps 
picking things up and saving them here.
Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop.
But no matter how you look at it, it's just trash...
Join the club.
Try it with us.
All right... 1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm.
I'm doing my best, bro'!
How's... this!?
Whew, times are bad.
...And then...
Hmm, hmmm, oh really?
Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter.
Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there 
all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore!
HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look!
You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout 
how things look.
Man... Should I go.... or not?
I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!
Hey!! Aren't you...?
What!! You mean, you're.... too?
You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a girlfriend 
to a place like this!?
What kind of guy are you!!
What... Me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My 
last memories of Midgar... you know.
But... That guy over there kinda scares me.
What the hell!! You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy 
right now!!
I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!
Urrgh... no way... I can't go on.
Things aren't working out.
Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it.
Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet your 
destiny here!!
You looking for a girlfriend too?
Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl.
But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.
Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls 
to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.
Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down 
and is in the market for a bride.
Hmm... Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.
The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. 
Shoo, shoo.
This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in 
Wall Market.
Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around 
here again...
Hey, and you got another cute one with you!
Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.
I'll tell Tifa about you.
No!! You can't!!
Why?
You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?
Then, what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in 
there, it'll cause too much commotion.
But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......
First, we'll need to find out if Tifa's alright....
What's so funny, Aerith?
Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.
WHAT!?
Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
Aerith! I can't.....
You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!
Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress.
Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?
What's the problem?
Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You 
see, he makes all the dresses.
And, where is your father?
He's probably plastered at the bar.
So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something 
about your father?
Yes. I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.
!
You'd help me bring him back?
Well, if don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?
Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what 
to do anymore....
All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud!
Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?
I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father.
I didn't say that....
Make me some clothes.
I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' 
anything right now.
Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to 
him.
Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.
You know, mister.
He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up as a girl.
So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him...
What!? A tough lookin guy like that?
So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?
...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just 
makin' regular clothes.
Then you'll do it for us?
Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?
Something...
And something....
Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste 
as him. I'll go talk to him.
Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on.
How... do you put this thing on?
Whoa! What are you doing!
It's still not right. A wig! That's what you need!
Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about 
getting one.
You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. 
Go and talk to them.
...'like you'? Aerith, what did you tell him?
Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!
You the one.... Who wants to be cute?
Cute?
Right.
And about the wig...
Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya.
Urrrrgh!!!
Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can 
beat the Big Bro!!
That's right!
So, you've got to compete with us!
You're right. Let's do squats.
All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!
Are you...?
THE beautiful Bro?
Beautful
What? You didn't know? Always running around here saying 
Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that....
Never mind that, come over here.
No. I'll explain the rules.
From the ready position, push Square button to squat, push X 
Button to get up, and push O Button to go back to the ready position.
So it's Square Button, X Button, O Button in that order.
Got it?
Whoever has the most squats at the end of 30 seconds gets the 
wig.
I'm not going to lose.
Big Bro's wig is MINE!!
Just be quiet...
It's not fair for you to start right away. So, you want 
practice?
Then, start practicing!
You had 20 squats.
Now let's begin the real thing. Start!
He had 17 squats and you had 20 squats.
You're really something. Okay, I'm a man of my word, here 
you are.
I'm so mad I'm so so so--- mad!
Shut up! Don't cry just because you lost!
Uuuhh, Bro's fists of steel cut to the bone!
Hey man. Got a minute? I need to talk... man to man.
Really! I really appreciate it.
......I'm sorry but, young lady? Would you turn the other way, 
for a second?
Why.....?
......Aerith.
Gosh!
I'm sorry, lady.
Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the 
inn?
I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't 
ask a girl to go get it.
What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, 
I got in a fight with the guy at the inn and can't go there anymore. 
Come on, so how 'bout it?
Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done.
Finished?
He means this?
I got it.
Oh, really!! Hey!
Geez.
And, what was it?
A protein drink set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more 
business than him, his head'll spin.
Thanks, bud. I'm motivated now. Take this, it's not much...
Hey! Is that a 'Member's Card' I see shining in your hot 
little hand?
Please, come in.
...Hmm. That's how you'll fool them.
......Hmmmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them.
Let's go!!
Poo, I uh, mean, Sir...
Hurry...
Please choose a room. (Gosh, he's so weird... but then again, 
they all are.)
Hmm, hmm, hmm.....
Ohhh, I just can't seem to lose weight. Hmm, hmm, hmm...
Sir!! You can't come in here.
(Yuk..... a pervert...)
Eyaah!
Don't!
Paste, paste, paste.....
(Oh God... here's another one of those guys. You know, the 
delicate type. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)
Fluff, fluff, fluff...
(Hmm! I guess he doesn't realize his position. I feel sorry for 
him. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)
Pita, pita, pita....
(God, what a pest! All right, get out of here! You dog...)
(That's it, I'll name him 'pooch'.)
Mix, mix, mix....
(What should I do... Is he following me? Really? What if he 
follows me home...?)
(Poochy'll do it, I'm sure of it...)
Shake, shake, shake...
(You think he's after me? Really? This guy makes me sick... And 
his eyes are weird too....)
(Yeah, don't hurt these guys' feelings. Let's at least say 'hi' 
to him.
Uhh.... Hel... Hello.
What a nice day, today.
By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm Cloud, a jack of all trades.
Oh, yeah...? Welcome, Cloud.
(Gross! Don't get carried away, remember your name is 'Pooch!')
Take care... Cloud.
BYE!! (Phew - I'm safe now...)
Eyaah!
Don't watch!
Oh my!! (...You're still here? Oh well, good timing anyway.)
Hey, what do you think about me?
NO WAY! I'M SO SHOCKED!!
Oh my!! Are you embarrassed? (Man!! Why are you so moody...)
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm......... hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm... hmm, hmm, hmm, 
hmm...
Phew... ...it's so tiring.
Oh!!
Is something the matter?
OH......!!
Hmph...!! Listen you, not that it matters, but you sure do 
know how to make people mad.
....Woooo...ow!
...wheez....
Phew....
What's wrong, Grandpa? You keep sighing.
...wheez... puff... You know, Grandma...
You talking about this room?
...whew... I know our son rented this for us and all, but....
It's too nice for us. Big round bed, gorgeous tub, I just can't 
get comfortable.
Don't worry about it. It's a high class neighborhood, in the Big 
City.
You keep complainin' and we'll get into trouble.
...wheez...
...Wooo...ow!
Psst... (Hey, shouldn't we stop him soon?)
...whisper... whisper... (We have a luncheon with President 
Shinra...)
Psst..... (You tell him.....)
Psst.... (I can't tell him........)
Psst.... (Come on!! Oh, well....)
Psst.... (I'm so disgusted with the President.)
Psst....(It's like this every time we have a business trip to 
Midgar.)
(We come all the way to Midgar, just for this....)
Psst.... (What're you complaining about. You're just holding the 
lights. I've gotta wear this heavy armor!)
Psst.... (I know, I know... but it's all part of the job.)
Psst.... (Oh yeah, did you hear? The President's wife found out 
about this little hobby of his.)
Psst... (Ha, ha.... No way, that's the first I've heard of it.)
Psst... (Oh, looks like he's done. Man, I'm glad!!)
Geez!! Mr. Prseident!! I mean, Your Majesty...
Ohhh... I'm sorry. Please remove the ancient curse!
I'll take this room.
All right, Now all we have to do is enter the room.
You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?
Oh, don't be angry with me.... (Geez.... this one' probably the 
violent type....)
All right, please.
This way, please.
Shall we begin?
I guess since you chose this room, that would mean you...
Hate being lonely?
I'm always alone.
I don't want to talk right now.
All right, all right. (...geez, you're so moody!)
Come on, everyone's waiting.
Here they are.
All right, everyone.
One, two! One, two!
Yeah!!
One, two!! One, two!!
Wassup!!
(Smile, smile, smile...)
Oh man...
What should I do...?
I've got no time to mess around with you.
Outta my way!
Looks like I'm going to be facing crises all my life...
...heave... pant...
Don't be so embarrassed! Loosen up, bubby!
...heave... pant...
Let's wash off all our sweat and dirt together!
Wassup!!
Bubby! You're the intimate type, huh!!
...heave... pant... Wow!! Would ya look at that!
Isn't bathing great...?
It soothes your heart.
How is it, bubby!?
Feels good, huh?
I don't feel good. Let me out...
Too stuffy in here...
You'll get used to it. Try counting to ten.
Ten...
Nine...
Hey bubby, how old are you?
Eight...
Twenty one...
You're less than half my age. I'm so jealous.
So how 'bout it...?
Do you wanna join my 
 group?
Seven...
Six...
Maybe in another life.
Well, if that's how you feel... too bad.
We have a trip planned at a cabin out in the country.
Five...
Four...
Three....
Two...
One...
Alright, that's ten. I'm gettin' out.
Why don't you stick around and play a bit?
Daddy's so lonely...
Bubby!!
This is important to
me.
Here's a memento of our time
together!
Hope we meet again!
This is SOME underwear.... I'm supposed to wear this...?
Well, if it's to save Tifa... I guess there's no way around.
I'll take this room.
All right, Now all we have to do is enter the room.
You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?
Oh, don't be angry with me.... (Geez.... this one's probably the 
violent type....)
All right, please.
Hmm.....? You.....?
What are you doing in a place like this?
That's what I want to ask you. Should you be foolin' around 
here?
You think problems will go away just thinkin' about them?
Oh no!
Help! Someone...! Hurry!
You can't change anything by just sitting back and looking at it.
What are you saying?
It's started moving.
What has?
Wake up!
rub, rub, rub..... rub, rub, rub, rub....
thump... pound.... thump... pound...
poik... poik... ...squish.
Uh... OW..!!
Wake up!!
Wake up!!
Phew, I'm so relieved.
Bubby!! I heard you collapsed.
No, no, no.
Don't get so uptight.
Hmm...? They say youth is so long but so short.
Let's give this next one your best shot.
Time's up. Bye, buddy.
Don't get depressed over a thing like this.
It happens to me all the time.
I'm so sorry... There's a lot of 'adult' things going on...
For your inconvenience, please take this, okay?
What, this rag? For me!? I just don't get it.
..........
If I were to dress up like a woman... Then I've got to really 
prepare carefully.
Seems like I could put makeup on here.
I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me too?
...paste, paste, paste.....
Oh... my.....
Uh, sir!! It's almost closing time...
So, please remember any personal belongings.
Uuuuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of 
cute girls...
It just seems more natural to get cautious...
Hey!! Cloud!!
Yes, what will you have?
Hmm...
One Today's Special.
Comin' up!
In this store, you pay first. It'll be 70 Gil.
Thank you. Just a second.
There you go. Enjoy.
It was all right
Thank you. Here's an item coupon for the Pharmacy.
You can exchange it for one item there.
We're out of coupons, so we stopped giving them away. Watch for 
our NEXT promotion!
Whoa!
Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?
Oh, you have a coupon. Then please select any one medicine you 
like.
Here you are.
HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look!
What... urk...
Huh? You'll really give me some? Thanks.
Phew, I feel better now. This is for your kindness.
Aren't you going to change?
Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.
Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?
Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his 
motivation back now. So the dress is on the house.
Walk more nicely like... this. Miss Cloud.
What do you mean 'nicely'?
Oh you're so cute, Miss Cloud.
Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?
How's this?
How about that one?
Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better.
No, what are you saying? This one.
...I want THIS one.
I'm going to go change.
......No peeking!
So? How do I look?
Oh, you're no fun!
Damn!! Your friend's hot, too!
Come in, come in!!
Two ladies coming through!
Hey, ladies.
I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go 
wandering around...
Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa.
...Tifa?
Nice to meet you. I'm Aerith.
Cloud's told me a lot about you.
...And you are?
Hey you're the one with Cloud in
the park...
Right, with Cloud.
Oh.....
Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?
No, don't misunderstand.
Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more.
Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call 
him nothing.
Right, Cloud?
Cloud?
????
Cloud!?
Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?
Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you 
hurt!?
Hey, give me a chance to explain.
I'm dressed like this... because there was no other way to get 
in here.
I'm all right. Aerith helped me out.
Oh, Aerith did...
Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?
Yeah, ummmm....
Ahem! I'll just plug my ears.
I'm glad you're OK.
Thanks. What happened?
When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird 
man.
So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
That's when the Don's name popped up.
Right, Don Corneo.
Barret told me to leave the lech alone...
But something's been bothering me.
I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's 
mouth.
So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.
Corneo is looking for a bride.
Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then.... 
...and, well.....
Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight.
Sorry... but I overheard...
If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
I guess so, but...
We have two here, right?
No, Aerith! I can't have you get involved.
Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?
No, I don't want Tifa in....
Is it all right?
I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.
Do you trust me?
Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aerith.
Call me Aerith.
He---y!!
It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!
I told ya not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays...
Hurry up, will ya!
I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is...
Me...... right?
You're right, there was no need...
...to ask.
All right, ladies!
Line up in front of the Don!
Hmmm! Good, splendid!
Now, let's see... Which girl
should I choose? Hmm--- hmm---!
This one?
Or this one?
Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!
My choice for tonight is.....
This little beauty!
Fu, fu, fu.... Be nice, Don.
This slender little girl!
Don, you've got great taste.
This healthy-looking girl!
Wa, wait a sec! I mean, uh, please wait a moment!
Woo-hoo!
I love chickies who play hard to get! Yeowza!
You can have the other ones!
Yes, sir! Thank you sir!
Well then, shall we go my pretty?
Hey guys! We've got guests.
We'll take REAL good care of you.
This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!
Heey!! Three cheers for Don Corneo!
Heh, heh.... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?
Hey... what's wrong? Want me to keep you company?
No... I'm flattered, but no thanks.
Because...
Because...?
Because...
I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!
Wha.... a MAN!???
God damn it! You think you can get away with this! Get him! 
Knock the crap out of him!!
Grr! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings!?
All right now, COME ON! I'll show you how it's done!!
Cloud!!
Tifa!!
Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!
Hey, don't you even care about how I am? ......never mind, let's 
go!
No--!! Help!!
No-!!
Ha ha ha... Wait, you!
I'm so sorry!
oh, oh, oh....
heh, heh, heh...
Aerith!!
I told you. I'm used to danger.
To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding.
Ye... yes, you're right... .....let's hurry!
Woo-hoo!
Come, come, don't be so shy...
I know....
But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something 
before we start...
Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?
Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?
No... I'm not asking about that......
Wa... wait a minute! No, not yet!!
Come! Come!
Aooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!
Cloud!!
Wha... what the hell? Who goes there?
You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?
Get what?
Woo-hoo!
Come, come, don't be so shy...
Ye... yes...
But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first...
Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by 
step. So come on!
No, that's not what I meant!
NO, STOP! Just, wait a second!!
Come! Come!
Aoooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!
Cloud!!
Wha... what the hell? Who goes there!?
I'm sorry, Don.
Get what?
Ahh, we're finally alone...
All right, pussycat... Come to daddy!
You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you.
Do you like me, too?
You don't like me?
There isn't someone else, is there?
No way!
Hmm? Barret? That sounds familiar...
You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out 
about. You know, AVALANCHE...?
Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7 in the slum...
...and how do YOU know that!?
You sure do know how to make a guy feel good!
Then wh... what do you want to DO?
Oh man! I can't stand it! All right, then....
Give me a kiss! A KISS!!
Ju---st a minute!!
Cloud...
Were you really...
A man!? What's goin' on?
Why? WHY? WHY?
Because...
Because I'm gonna have to use that mouth of yours to give me 
some information!!
A man!? You tricked me!!
Somebody get in here NOW!!
Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.
You're the ones from before! Wh... what the hell's going on?
Shut up, we're asking the questions now...
What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell 
us...
...I'll chop them off.
No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
So... talk.
...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But 
that's what I was ordered to do.
By who?
No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!
Talk! If you don't tell us...
...I'll rip them off.
Waaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!
Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!
The head of Public Safety Maintenance?
Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!
If you don't tell us...
I'll smash them.
...You're serious, aren't you.... ...ohboy, ohboy, ohboy.
... I'm not fooling around here either, you know.
Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, 
and want to infiltrate their hideout.
And they're really going to crush them... literally.
By breaking the support holding up the plate above them.
Break the support!?
You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING
and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the 
Sector 7 Slums...
I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?
Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?
Of course, Tifa.
Just a second!
Shut up!
No wait, it'll only take a second.
How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the 
truth?
Buuzzzzz! Wrong!
Woo-hoo! Right!
Close, but no cigar!
How are the preparations going?
Ha, ha, ha!! Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to 
this.
President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a 
group with only a few members...
What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?
...No.
But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been 
involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why...
Reeve, you should flush those personal problems in the morning!
The Mayor's against this anyway....
Mayor?
He just sits in his building all day feeding his face! You 
still call that a Mayor?
Now if you'll excuse me sir!
You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go 
somewhere.
We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then 
we'll send in the rescue operation care of Shinra, Inc... Heh, heh, heh... 
this is perfect.
You alright?
Yeah.
You alright?
Man! This is terrible.
Well, the worst is over...
Maybe not...
It's too late..... Marlene... Barret... the people of the slums.
Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the 
pillar, right?
......Yeah..... you're right! We still have time.
Aerith. I got you mixed up in all of this...
Don't tell me to go home.
Let's see... If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, 
we should be able to get out of here.
We made it! The pillar's
standing!
Wait! You hear something.... above us?
.....gun fire?
Wedge!! You all right!?
.......Cloud...... You remembered..... my name.
Barret's up top. ...help him.......
An' Cloud.... Sorry, I wasn't any help.
I'm going up!
Aerith! You look after Wedge.
Aerith, do me a favor.
I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.
There's a little girl named Marlene there......
Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
It's dangerous here!
Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!
Everyone get out of Sector 7!
L, look... This is my job, so I have to be here until the 
absolute last minute.
Umm.... I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here 
with you.
Uhh..... Help! My strange and wonderful little place.
Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!
I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great..... I'm 
quitting tomorrow!
Uh oh..... There goes the pillar.
I'm scared, but it's for you own good.
If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll 
see happen very often.
Don't worry, you let me handle this.
Cloud... so you don't care... what happens... to the.... Planet?
Hmph.... you haven't changed. Oh, forget it.
Thanks, Cloud.
...don't worry 'bout me.... Barret's... fighting up there. Go 
help him....
....Cloud... I'm glad.... I could talk with you one last time.
That's.... all right......
Because of our actions... many....... people died...... this 
probably.... is our punishment.....
...Is.. that so......?
Ha...... cool...... as usual... ex-SOLDIER. ...always... I liked 
that.... in you....
Tifa! Cloud! You came!
Be careful! They're attacking
from the helicopter.
Better equip ourselves before
they attack in full force!
Here they come!
You're too late. Once I push this button...
That's all, folks! Mission accomplished.
We have to disarm it! Cloud! Barret! Please!
I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of Reno and the 
Turks...
It's time.
Cloud! I don't know how to stop this! Try it!
It's not a normal time bomb.
That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.
It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
Please, stop it!
Ha ha ha.....
Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate 
Release System.
Shut yer hole!
I wouldn't try that.... You just might make me injure our 
special guest.
Aerith!!
Oh, you know each other?
How nice you could see each other one last time. You should 
thank me.
What are you gonna do with Aerith?
I haven't decided.
Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.
It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to 
the President.
Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!
Aerith!
Hurry and get out!
Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think 
you can escape in time?
Once that plate starts coming down it's too late. We gotta hurry!
Yo, we can use this wire to get out!
Marlene!!
MAR---LE---NE!!
Biggs!
Wedge!!
Jessie!
GOD DAMN IT!!
DAMMIT!!
DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!
What the hell's it all for!?
ARGGHHHH!!!
Hey, Barret!
Barret!
ARGGHHHH!!!
Hey!
Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret.
URGHHHH!!!
God damn...
Marlene...
....... Barret......?
Marlene is.... I think Marlene is safe.
....huh?
Right before they took Aerith, she said, 'Don't worry, she's all right.' She was probably talking about Marlene.
R, really!?
But...
Biggs...... Wedge.... Jessie......
All three of them were in the pillar.
Think I don't know that?
But... we, all of us fought together.
I don't wanna think of them as dead!
And the other people in Sector 7.
This is all screwed up!
They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed 
so many people....
...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? I
nnocent people lost their lives because of us?
No, Tifa!
That ain't it! Hell no!!
It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but 
the Shinra!
They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to...
build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!
If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet!
Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!
............I don't know.
What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
It's not that. I'm not sure about ... me. My feelings.
An' what about you?
...........
Yo!
Where's he think he's goin'?
Oh! Aerith!
Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?
...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene 
with.
Damn! Marlene!!
Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Cloud!
Take me to Marlene!
You're going to help Aerith?
Yeah.... But before that, there's something I want to know.
What's that?
It's about the Ancients.
Sephiroth...?
Are you all right?
Pull it together, man!
Cloud...... wasn't it?
It's about Aerith, isn't it?
...Sorry. The Shinra have her.
I know. They took her from here.
They were here?
That's what Aerith wanted...
Why is Shinra after Aerith?
Aerith is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
...Not her real mother. Oh... it must have been 15 years ago...
...during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far 
away place called Wutai.
One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he 
was coming home on leave.
Please take Aerith somewhere safe.
Aerith and I became close very quickly. That child loved to 
talk. She used to talk to me about everything.
She told me she escaped form some sort of research laboratory 
somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she 
wasn't lonely... and many other things.
Returned to the planet?
I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the 
sky.
But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child 
in many ways.
Mom.
Please don't cry.
Aerith just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her 
if something had happened...
Someone dear to you has just died.
His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to 
the planet.
At that time I didn't believe her.
But...
Several days later... We received a notice saying my husband 
had died...
...and that's how it was.
A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day...
We want you to return Aerith to us. We've been saerching for 
her for a long time.
No! Never!
Aerith, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.
Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
Of course I heard it. That she was an Ancient.
The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.
Aerith will be able to bring happiness to all those in the 
slums.
That is why Shinra would like Aerith's cooperation.......
He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
But Aerith, surely you hear voices
sometimes when you're all alone?
No, I don't!
But I knew. I knew about her
mysterious powers...
She tried so hard to hide it, so I
acted as though I never noticed.
It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years...
The Shinra needed her. So I guess they wouldn't harm her.
But, why now.....
She brought a little girl here with her.
On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get 
away fast enough.
She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little 
girl's safety.
Must be Marlene.
Marlene!! Aerith was caught because of Marlene!?
I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm ...really... sorry...
You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a 
child alone like that!?
...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. 
What would happen to Marlene, if I...
But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. 
I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight.
'Cause if I don't... the planet's gonna die.
So I'm gonna keep fightin'!
But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with 
her... always.
See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs 
asleep. Why don't you go and see her.
It's my fault... I was the one who got Aerith involved in this.
Don't say that. Aerith doesn't think that.
I'm so glad....... I'm so glad you're all right...
Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!
Cloud!
You gonna go help Aerith, right? She's done so much for me....
If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! 
I'm comin', too!
Guess what? Guess what? Aerith was asking me lots of questions.
Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!
Stupid!
I won't tell Tifa.
You're going after Aerith, right?
Yeah.
I'm going with you.
We're going right into Shinra headquarters. ...You gotta be 
prepared for the worst.
I know.
Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.
If I stayed here... I'll go crazy.
Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
Yes, I don't mind.
This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get 
yourself killed.
How do we get to the Shinra Building?
There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...
.....
Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find 
something there.
You goin' up to the plate? You better have a battery.
You're gonna sell me something you just found?
Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right.
Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?
You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for 
each?
.......
Wanna see something awesome? Follow me!
Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary.... Brr.
Can we climb it?
Yeah. It leads to the Upper World.
Awright! We'll climb this wire!
There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
Just a normal wire.
Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
You're right. This is the only way to save Aerith...
Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you 
feel.
Let's go!
Oh man! This is horrible...
Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
Hey, you oughta know this building well.
......Not really, now that I think about it.
This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters.
I heard about this place before.
Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to 
even for employees.
Must be where they took Aerith.
The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!
Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through 
the main entrance, are you?
Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra 
butt and.......
That's not going to work! We've got to find another way....
Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, 
Aerith'll.....
I know that! But if we get caught here....
Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?
That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!
Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have 
to...
Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency!
Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta 
the way!!
Yaagghh!
Who do they think they are?
Hey, you don't think that's AVALANCHE?
Intruders! Sieze them!!
Let's go to the top!
See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
Yo... You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
Well we've got to get to Aerith to help her somehow.
Talk about out of the way...
I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!
Y, yo, Tifa! Don't go off alone!
Don't know... why the hell... we gotta climb...
...because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved 
Aerith.
I doubt that's possible though...
...heh heh heh.
Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured 
wrong I guess.
Who cares what you figured!
I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong...
Heh heh heh.......
What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?
How much farther do these stairs go on?
Why don't you ask them?
It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya 
think?
Of course not!!
Right... couldn't be that....
Are we there yet?
Not yet.
...there yet?
I said not yet!
Yo...
Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being 
there, ok!?
Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!
And take just as long going down as you did coming up?
.............
C'mon, Barret. Pull it together!
Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood.... 'cept 
for this arm of mine.
Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or 
somethin'........
What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm 
going on!
......?
Yaah! Barret! You go first!
What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that...
All right, all right!
Cloud, you go on ahead too!!
Yo... What floor is this?
...I gave up counting.
Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?
That Shinra.... They're just no damn good.
.........
huff.... Man, I'm beat...
Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time...
Would you stop acting like a retard and climb?
It's just a bit more!
...maybe.
F... finally... M... made it...
N... never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...
huff... puff... this really takes it out of you...
But this is it. We'd better get ready...!
Destroy the intruders!
What's this?
This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
I hope Aerith is all right.
People like you don't belong here! Go on, get out!
What're you doing here!? No unauthorized people are allowed 
here!!
Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around.
Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come.
Ok! We gonna rock!
Remember, we're here to save Aerith.
Hell, I know that!
What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?
Even employees can't walk around above the 60th floor without a 
keycard..
This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for 
the big wigs in the company.
It's tough working under someone. Tires you out.
I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know 
what that was all about?
No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th 
floor is safe.
The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?
Aerith? How did you know that name? You must be...!?
Aerith, you mean that kid. The receptionist. Yeah, I was 
startin' to worry 'bout her myself.
And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?
You mean, she's not? It's someone else?
Oh, I see. So you must be the whatcha call it...
Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!
You know, it looks like this building is starting to fall apart.
This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right 
away.
Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors too. I'll give 
you this.
I don't remember seeing your face here. You new here?
Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some... things.
Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach 
you how to get to the next floor.
The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th 
floor. But you can't get there without a keycard.
Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely.
...voila! You hear that sound and the door opens.
Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard 
won't let you go everywhere.
For example, 'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. 'Keycard 65' 
only takes you to the 65th floor.
It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, all the 
power in Midgar and the world, for that matter, is controlled by them.
Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!
Oh? That's too bad...
How do you do?
This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his 
office.
I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel 
free to ask me...
Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?
You all must be those... ahem.... Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of 
Midgar.
Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it 
is really run by Shinra, Inc.
My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents...
Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh.......
You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the 
password, I'll give you my keycard.
Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my 
keycard!
Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!
Did you speak with the Mayor?
What? A password? Oh, I get it...
He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really 
blame him. Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.
Maybe I can help you.
Got it?
Then tell me.
BEST!!
God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best..... ME!! No 
matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.
......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it.
I never thought you'd get it on the first try...
Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, 
a promise is a promise. Take this, too.
Why would I do something like this, you ask?
To mess with them, of course! Shinra's been torturing me 
forever.
That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up 
there and really make them suffer.
This ought to make us even! Heh heh heh.....

Hanging on to this won't do any
good...
Midgar.... born from Mako energy which was sucked right out of 
the earth. A model of the city....
When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be 
complete.
That must be why he took Aerith....
Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files.
But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of 
being a secretary!

         Phew!
Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some 
sort of stench coming from somewhere....
Hey, when you're in the bathroom, do you ever hear whispers 
coming from somewhere?
They're having another executive meeting. I wonder if it's about 
that Plate incident.
It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving 
this world, just with my hands.
Come on, we're building the future of Mako!
Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
We have the damage estimates for Sector 7.
Considering those factories we already set up and all the 
investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil...
The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is...
We're not rebuilding.
What?
We're leaving Sector 7 as it is.
And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.
...then the Ancients?
The Promised Land will soon be ours.
I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.
Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space 
Program in the budget!
Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate 
increase.
Oh man!
Sir, if you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence...
It'll be all right.
The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust 
Shinra, Inc. even more.
Ha ha ha!
After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!
That dirty #$*$^
Hojo. How's the girl?
As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the 
process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference 
is 18%.
How long will the research take?
Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our 
lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.
That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create 
one that would withstand our research for a long time.
What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?
That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has 
her weaknesses.
That concludes our meeting.
Something stinks...
They were talking about Aerith... right?
I dunno.
Probably.
Let's follow 'em.
Hojo... huh...?
I remember him.
That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science 
Department. Cloud, don't you know him?
This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So... 
that's what he looks like...
Is this today's specimen?
Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
My precious specimen...
Precious specimen...?
Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
Jenova...
Jenova... Sephiroth's... So... they've brought it here.
Cloud, be strong!
Did you see it?
See what?
It's moving........ still alive?
Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep 
goin'.
Aerith!
Aerith? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?
We're taking Aerith back.
Outsiders.....
Shoulda noticed it earlier, you...
There's so many frivolous things in this world.
Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.
The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could 
operate it? Hmm?
Ugh.
That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before 
you make any rash moves.
Now, bring in the Specimen!
Cloud, help!
What do you think you're doin'?
Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them 
are on the brink of extinction...
If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.
...animal? That's terrible! Aerith is a human being!
You're gonna pay!
Barret! Can't you do anything?
Awright!! Step back!
Stop!
Wh... what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens...
Now's our chance to get Aerith!
Thanks, Cloud.
Cloud... what's wrong?
...The elevator is moving.
This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.
It talked!?
I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss.
We'll take care of that monster.
Somebody take Aerith somewhere safe...
What's your name?
Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever 
to me. Call me whatever you wish.
Come on!
Aerith, you all right?
She seems all right, ...in many ways.
I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things.
What are you?
An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you 
see.
...You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of 
here. I'll lead the way.
Cloud... so you did come for me.
I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to 
throw Hojo off guard......
Now we've saved Aerith, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So 
let's get the hell outta here!
If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up 
into two groups.
I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor 
Elevator.
We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do.
To prove it to you.... here, this is the key card to the 68th 
Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?
H, hey! What is it?
Would you press 'Up' please?
Turks? Must be a trap...
It must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?
Ggh...
You all got caught, too?
Where is Aerith!?
In a safe place.
She's the last surviving Ancient...
Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived 
thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history.
Cetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?
Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised 
Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her.
The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue.
It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile.
...If the land is fertile...
Then there's gotta be Mako!
Exactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is a 
necessity.
The abundant Mako will just come out on its own.
That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory...
@$#^%! Quit dreamin'!
Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your 
dreams to come true is money and science.
Well, that is all for our meeting.
Come on! Outta his way!
Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!
If you need something else... talk to my secretary.
Psst (Can we get out?)
Psst (Cloud, you're so brave!)
Psst (Don't give up!)
Hey!
Aerith is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is 
Cetra.
The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is 
searching for that Promised Land.
I only hear stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it 
really exists.
Is that right?
The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako 
energy.
Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the 
Mako energy.
...and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.
I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!!
Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aerith too.
How 'bout you?
You're so damn boring.
............Grandpa.
Grandpa!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm.... ha, ha, ha.......
What's so funny?
Nothin'...... ha, ha
Cloud, are you there?
Aerith!? You safe?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I knew that Cloud would come for me.
Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?
The deal was for one date, right?
............oh, I get it.
...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!
EXCUSE me.
You know, Aerith, I have a question.
What?
Does the Promised Land really exist?
...I don't know.
All I know is...
The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and 
unlock the Planet.
And....... then......
The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises 
supreme happiness.
...What does that mean?
More than words...... I don't know.
...Speak with the Planet?
Just what does the Planet say?
It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what 
they're saying.
You hear it now?
I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said 
that Midgar was no longer safe. That is.... my real mother.
Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find 
my Promised Land.
...That's what mom said.
I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but....
The door's open... When did it open?
What's happened?
Tifa... Wake up!
What's wrong?
Something's wrong. Look outside.
I wonder what happened...
He should have the key on him...
Come on, Tifa, get Aerith, I'll go help Barret and the others.
Barret, Red XIII... come with me. Something's wrong.
How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
The hell's goin' on!?
No human could've done this.
I'll go on ahead.
I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get 
caught by Shinra!
Come on, let's follow Red XIII!
...Did it get away? Jenova...?
Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using 
that elevator for the specimens.
It looks like it leads up...
He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead.
Then this sword must be...!?
Sephiroth's!!
...Sephiroth is alive?
...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra now!
Uh!
P, p, p, please, don't kill me!
What happened?
Se... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
Yeah, I saw him!! I saw him with my own eyes!
You really saw him?
Uh! Would I lie to you at a time like this!? And I heard his 
voice too!
Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the 
Promised Land.
Then what?
Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that 
Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
So he's a good guy then?
Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!
It's not that simple!! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is 
different!
Rufus! &*%$!!  I forgot about him!
Who's that?
Vice President Rufus. The President's son.
I wonder what kind of person he
is...
I've heard that no one's ever seen
him bleed or cry.
I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long 
time...
I only know his name.
So... So Sephiroth was actually here. ...By the way.
Who are you guys?
I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!
I'm from AVALANCHE!
Same here!
...a flower girl from the slums.
A research specimen.
What a crew.
Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.
You only President, 'cause your old man died!
That's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech.
...Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to 
have been working.
The population thought that Shinra would protect them.
Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra 
army will help you.
It looks perfect on the outside.
But, I do things differently.
I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it 
like my old man.
A little fear will control the minds of the common people. 
There's no reason to waste money on them.
He likes to make speeches just like his father.
Get outta this building with Aerith!
What?
I'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the 
Planet!
The hell's that supposed to mean?
I'll tell you later! Just take my word for it! I'll go after 
I take care of him!
Awright, Cloud!
Cloud... I just thought of something.
...I'll wait for Cloud! Everyone, get to the elevator!
Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should 
check on our equipment.
Why do you want to fight me?
You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
Hm, exactly.
Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or 
Sephiroth have the Promised Land!
I see. I guess this means we won't become friends.
Heh... That's all for today.
Where's Rufus?
I couldn't finish 'em. Looks like this's gonna get complicated.
I'll go on ahead!
*&^%(*... surrounded, huh?
If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation 
to protect.
You all get out while you can.
It's not you they're after... it's me.
Yeah, well that ain't happenin'.
You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to 
watch out for you!
Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses...
...thank you, Mr. Barret!
Who you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right!
Well then...
If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way 
to get out of here.
Huh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like somone else 'round 
here I know.
Did you say something?
Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?
Barret!
Tifa! Where's Cloud?
Everyone, over here!
Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?
I'll tell you later! Hurry, Hurry!!
Well, what do we do now?
Sephiroth is alive. I... I have to settle the score.
And that'll save the Planet?
...Seems like it.
Awright, I'm going.
I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.
About the Ancients?
.......Many things.
I guess this's good bye, Midgar.
I'm going backto my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.
...I guess this is the start of our journey...
...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I 
guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.
.....Mmm. but you know, it should be all right if you keep your 
promise.
You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar...
A little,... no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?
I thought you'd say that!
We told Aerith's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be 
safe too.
She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe 
it's for the best.
Stop it, Cloud! I'm worried too.
Then...
We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could 
be the leader.
You think so...?
It would have to be Cloud.
^#$^%....... awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If 
something happens, we'll meet up there.
'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. Split 
us into 2 parties...
...Thought you'd do that.
'Later, at Kalm!
So this is Kalm?
I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the 
inn!
Let's go Cloud.
Cloud, you're late!
Yo man, you're late!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Guess everyone's here now.
So let's hear your story......
You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the 
planet.
Let's hear it all.
......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.
After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became 
friends.
You call that a friend?
Yeah, well.......
He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself.
............
So I guess you'd call him a war buddy..... We trusted each 
other. Until one day......
...one day?
After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance 
against the Shinra.
...........that was 5 years ago.
I was 16........
It sure is raining hard.
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm all right.
I wouldn't know...
I've never had motion sickness.
Everything okay?
Hey.
Settle down.
They gave me new Materia.
I can't wait to use it.
...just like a kid.
You going to brief us about this mission?
...this isn't a typical mission.
Good!
Why do you say that?
I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you.
But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.
My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.
That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind 
of a way to prove myself.
Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?
...I thought you wanted a briefing?
Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.
There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing 
brutal creatures.
First, we will dispose of those creatures, Then, we'll locate 
the problem and neutralize it.
Brutal creatures... Where?
The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
Nibelheim...
That's where I'm from.
Hmm... hometown...
Sir...s, something strange just crashed into our truck!
That would be our Monster...
Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality 
than any story you might have heard about him.
So... Where do you come in?
Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
..........
......and then we reached Nibelheim.
How does it feel?
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?
So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...
Umm.... how 'bout your parents?
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. 
My father...
What does it matter...?
All right, let's go.
Psst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get into 
trouble.)
It's so boring, being on watch.
Shall we practice?
Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose.
Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what 
other people think?
...How did it go?
Was it like this?
Good job!
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
Just sit tight, it's your job, right?
I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.
The Mako smell is pretty bad here.
Yo wait a minute!!
Isn't that, um...?
The name of Sephiroth's mother...
I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the 
Shinra building.
That's right.
Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You 
can ask questions later.
Tifa, I was only......
Okay Cloud, continue.
It's a reunion of childhood pals!
......I was really surprised with Tifa.
...The town was quiet.
Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out 
because of the monsters.
No, maybe they're afraid of us...
We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep 
early.
All that we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.
Oh, that's right...
You may visit your family and friends.
Man.. I'm so nervous.
Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?
...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero...
I heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready.
I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
I don't take pictures with nobodys.
All right... so big-headed.......
Hey? This guy's a real...
You.... Are you Cloud?
Really? So that's how it is, huh?
Gosh, Cloud, you've grown up to be a nice-looking kid.
Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with 
Sephiroth.
OK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant
Welcome.
Hey? Aren't you...
...Have I come here before? ...I don't remember.
Now you're pissin' me off! This don't matter, so get on with it!
This is... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident 
five years ago.
Yo wait, I wanna hear.
Me too! It's been a long time, right?
Tell us more!
You saw your family, right?
Well I ain't gonna force ya.....
I don't know if you could call it a 'family'........
My father... died when I was still very young.
That's why my mom...... was living alone in this house.
Yeah, I saw my mom.
My mom... she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all.
But a few days later, she died....
But when I saw her, she looked fine.
Uh...?
Ye---s?
Cloud!?
Welcome home, Cloud!
Hi, mom.
Come, come... Let me take a look at you!
Hmmm.......
You look so handsome.
So is this a SOLDIER uniform?
......Mom, I....
My, how you've grown.
I bet the girls never leave you alone.
...Not really.
...I'm worried about you.
There are a lot of temptations in the city...
I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice 
girlfriend.
...I'm all right.
You should have...
an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.
I think that would be the perfect type for you.
......I'm not interested.
Are you eating right?
I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
Is that so?
You can't cook, right?
I was worried sick about how you were doing...
Cloud...?
You know, Cloud......
.......isn't that right, Cloud?
I will always be your mother...
.........Let's stop this......
Cloud...?
Did you go into my house?
I thought you might be home.
I remember you weren't there.
Cloud...?
Did you go into my room?
Cloud!!!
...Cloud
We're talking about something really important here.
...Cloud
We're talking about something really important here.
Did you play my piano?
Now, how did this go?
I can read sheet music, too, you know..... Ummmm, let's 
see......
Do... Re.... Mi... Ti... La... Do... Re... Mi... Ti... La....
Do... Re.... Do.... forget...
The letter...
Did you read it? My letter?
Of course!
You remember what it said?
Then. let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
I read it...
It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that 
runs the General Store...
Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.
Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only 
person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud.
But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if 
we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.
Well, enough about him.
Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so 
behind on everything... so out of it.
Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.
Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a 
really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some 
money.
...but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job fast. That's 
right. I still haven't found a job yet.
I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with 
Shinra, Inc.
I wonder if it's too late to back. Sometimes I think I should've 
taken over my parents' store.
Cloud, do you remember all of it?
Then. let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
Because there was some stuff about me...
I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is 
Nibelheim.
Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working?
Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at 
the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?
And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen 
you for years.
We were all talking about you last night.
Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I 
couldn't very well stab them in the back.
I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being 
jilted.
Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!
So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.
P.S. Write me back, okay?
...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.
Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, Cloud! I didn't recognize you.
Shinra----?
Chinra---?
SOLDIER?
Saltza?
Are you going to kill the monsters?
.....are you going to?
Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man.
Do your best.
Do your best.
.....Hmmmm
Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
And who are you?
I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial 
arts.
I have 128 students all over the world!
In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student.
Did you say Tifa?
Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.
The, uh.... The whole Inn's booked up by Shinra for the night.
...?
Cloud...?
Is it you, Cloud?
It must've been two years.
Say, you've really moved up in the world, being under Sephiroth's 
command.
What are you looking at?
...This scenery.......I feel like I know this place.
...........
We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.
I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.
I've heard she's young. I hope we can rely on her...
Once the guide gets here, we're heading out.
Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens...
...Trust me.
I'll be all right, Dad!
I have two men from SOLDIER with me.
I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you!
Tifa! You're the guide?
That's right.
I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.
It's too dangerous! I can't involve you in something like this!
Then there's no problem if you respect her.
....Let's go.
Ummm.....
Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!
Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?
Cheeeeese!
Great, thank you!
I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!
It gets harder from here! Follow
me!
Uh... the bridge!!
Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?
These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm...
Oh, and Sephiroth.... There seems to be one person missing...
It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We 
can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.
What's this?
A mysteriously colored cave...
It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant 
in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
...And what's this?
A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
It's so beautiful...
If the Mako Reactor countinues to suck up the energy, this 
fountain will dry up too...
Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced.
It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state.
By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also 
use magic too?
You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?
...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the 
materia.
Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land
 and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet 
calling up magic..... or so they say.
Magic...... a mysterious power.
Ha, ha, ha!
Did I say somethin' funny?
A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as 
mysterious power! It shouldn't even be called magic!
I still remember how angry he was.
Who was that?
Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take 
over the work of a great scientist.
He was a walking mass of complexes.
A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the A
ncients is.
We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
Tifa, you wait here.
I'm going inside too! I wanna see!
Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of 
Shinra's industrial secrets.
But!
Take care of the lady.
Mm, man!
Better take real good care of me then!
This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open...
This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken.
Cloud, close the valve.
Why did it break...?
...now I see, Hojo.
But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as 
Professor Gast.
This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... 
that is, when it's working correctly.
Now, what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?
Uh, umm...... Oh yeah!  It becomes a Materia.
Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take 
a look.
Look through the window.
Wh... what is this!?
Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered 
with Mako.
You're different from the others, but still human.
But what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of 
Mako, far more than you.
...Is this some kind of monster?
Exactly. And it's Hojo if Shinra that produced these monsters.
Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what 
these monsters really are.
Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
H... hey, Sephiroth!
N... no....
...Was I?
...Was I created this way too?
Am I the same as all these monsters.....
...Sephiroth.
You saw it! All of them.... were humans....
Human!? No way!
....I've always felt since I was small...
That I was different from the others. Special, in some way.
But... not like this....
Damn, Shinra! the more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret 
like that.
That would seem to explain the increase in the number of 
monsters recently.
I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so 
Barret?
(Why you talkin' to me!?)
Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?
Tifa.... You were waiting outside then?
.....Yes.
We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. 
He didn't even try to talk to me.
Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.
Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion...
There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this 
room...
....an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 
year old geological stratum.
Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova...
X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient...
X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako 
Reactor 1 approved for use...
My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a 
coincedence?
Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did 
you die?
Sephiroth seems different.
Ha, ha, ha...
Who is it!?
Hmph... traitor.
Traitor?
You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you.
This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a 
itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on...
At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the 
Promised Land and supreme happiness.
But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped 
their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life.
They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without 
giving one whit in return!
Those are your ancestors.
Sephiroth...
Long ago, disaster struck this planet.
Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid.
The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your 
ancestors continued to increase.
Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports.
What does that have to do with you?
Don't you get it?
An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 
2000 years ago.
The Jenova Project.
The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of 
the Ancients..... no, the Cetra.
...I am the one that was produced.
Pr... produced!?
Yes.
Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius 
scientist, produced me.
How... how did he...?
Se... Sephiroth?
Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother.
Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?
Then come over here and help me!
I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
Hey, Ummm... Am I going to die?
Sephi... roth
Terrible...
Sephiroth... This is too terrible...
Papa...
Sephiroth!?
Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!?
Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything!
I hate them all!
Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door.
How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?
...You promised... You promised that you'd come.... when I was 
in trouble...
Mother, let's take this planet back together.
I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land.
Sephiroth...
My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?
Ha, ha, ha..... They've come again, mother.
With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was 
destined to become the ruler of this Planet.
What about MY sadness!? My family... friends... The sadness of 
having my hometown taken away from me!?
It's the same as your sadness!
Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?
I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this 
Planet.
I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people 
for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?
Sephiroth.... I trusted you...
No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!
....and that's the end of my story.
Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?
....I don't remember.
What happened to Sephiroth?
In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him.
Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the 
newspaper.
Shinra, Inc. owns the newspaper, so you can't rely on that i
nformation.
......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened 
then.
I challenged Sephiroth amd lived. Why didn't he kill me?
.......I'm alive, too.
Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? 
It was in the Shinra building, right?
Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.
Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from 
the Shinra building.
Sephiroth.....?
Damn! Don't none of this make sense!
I'm going, going, going, gone!
And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!
Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!
Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth 
heads for the Promised Land?
I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If 
they do, then we're all screwed.
Y'know what I'm sayin'!
Y'all jes' leave it to me!
Oh brother...
Fine! That's good enough.
Yo, c'mon let's go!
Oh brother...
..........
Cloud...?
How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?
I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad.
..........
I...
The Ancients..... Cetra.... Jenova...... Sephiroth and 
myself.....
Let's go. Barret's waiting.
What a fascinating story.....
Yo, Cloud. Here.
PHS.
[PHS], will put us in constant contact with each other.
Awright then, we're outta here..
Listen to me! 
         Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards 
that grassy field.
And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary.......
Tourists, huh? There are some things you should know that'll 
come in handy when you travel around the world........
Want me to tell you what they are?
Then let me explain how to use the world map.
Well then, what do you want to know?
First of all, press the [L2 button] on the controller to change 
the camera angle.
There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like.
You can then rotate the angles either way by pressing the 
[L1 button] and [R1 button].
Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It 
makes the journey a lot more fun!
Press the [Start button] once to view the World Map.
There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which, and you 
won't get lost as much.
Push the [Start button] twice to change the size of the map, and 
once more to turn it off.
Pretty easy, huh?
You can ride things by pressing the [SELECT button] and get off 
by pressing the [cancel button]. This isn't so hard, either!
Oh, yes, yes. You can't dash with the World Map on, so make sure 
not to press the [cancel button] unless you get off.
Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get 
off them, so be careful.
Is that so? Well, have a nice trip.
Thanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, 
everything's more convenient now.
The famous floating city, Midgar... Just once I'd love to see it 
in person.
I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new 
president, was badly hurt.
Hey, I bet that's news to you?
Heh, heh, heh.... This is just between us. I heard it was that 
there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son.
Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on 
what Shinra's doing.
Shinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are 
just gonna sit back and take it?
I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being 
sucked dry.
We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy.
My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after 
monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine.
Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar...
Is it true that Shinra made a Monster?
Yeah, well, either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we 
can't stand up to Shinra.
I got my health, and enough to eat... all's well.
Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to 
Shinra.
Don't you think?
See!? How would we get by without Mako energy?
Hmmn. But I hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako 
energy.
Yeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all 
thanks to Shinra, Inc.
Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient.....
But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been 
disappearing at a rapid pace.
I think the old life was better.
Don't you think so?
Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?
That sounds just like what my mom says.
I thought things were better when I was able to play with 
animals....
Did you say you came from
Midgar?
I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles 
lately.
There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was 
carrying a wicked-looking sword.
My older brother is so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could 
just puke!
When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training 
so hard now!!
I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor....
There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents lately. I hate 
it, just hate it.
Me? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril 
Mine.
But, right around then, monsters started appearing.
After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here 
drinking.
It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around,
but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER.
Stay out of the kitchen.
This is the Item Store.
This is the Materia store.
This is the Weapons store.
wark wark
Thinking of crossing the marshes?
Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo.
That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo.
It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.
Midgar Zolom...?
It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!
It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes...
And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!
To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill and Choco Billy 
Chocobo Farm.
To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the 
Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm.
Hmm, then, I guess that's that.
Do you want a Chocobo?
Mmm......
You old folks are out of luck!
Old folks...?
We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out 
there for someone else.
You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and 
catch one.
Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear 
in those areas.
But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. 
They're very cautious animals by nature.
'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos.
If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they 
won't appear.
Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters.
But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters.
That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch 
the Chocobo.
Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from 
the slightest things.
But, if you use 'Greens' they'll focus on that, and won't run 
away.
Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, 
but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt.
Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape.
Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
Oh, I'm so glad!
Well then, shall we get down to business?
I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now.
You want it?
Thanks!
It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either.
Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type 
of 'Greens you feed them.
Mmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one.
Wasn't it really expensive?
But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa.
Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this...
By the way, there was another person heading towards the 
Marshes.
Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a 
man in a Black Cape.
Did Sephiroth... do this...?
Amazing...
Our enemy is someone that could
do this...?
Just a second!
Who are you?
Do you know who I am?
Well if you know, this won't take long.
It's difficult to explain what the Turks do...
Kidnapping, right?
To put it negatively... you could say that.
...But, that's not all there is to it, anymore.
.................
...................
Sir!
It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't 
force it!
...Then Elena, explain.
I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you 
did to Reno, we're short of people.
...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks....
In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed.
And to try and stop you every step of the way.
Wait a minute, it's the other way around. You're the ones that 
are getting in our way.
...Elena. You talk too much.
Mr. Tseng!?
No need to tell them about our orders.
Sorry... Tseng.
I thought I gave you other orders.
Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
Oh! Right!
Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for 
Junon Harbor!
...Elena. You don't seem to understand.
Oh! I'm, I'm sorry...
...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.
Yes sir!
...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave 
him healed.
He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new 
weapon.
Well, then...
Aerith. Long time no see.
Looks like you got away from Shinra for a while, now that 
Sephiroth reappeared.
...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to 
Sephiroth?
No...
Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care.
...strange, hearing that from you.
Well then, stay out of Shinra's way.
What happened to this town? It's so run-down...
Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than 
the Shinra people visit this town.
Ever since... Shinra built that city up above during the war, 
...ugh, ugh.
There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted... phew...
What kinda place is this?
Who are you people? Where did you come from?
Did you see a man with a black cape?
Hmm... I've never seen that feller before.
HEY! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around 
here!!
If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it.
He-y! Mr. Dolphin!
My name is...... 
         Pri-scil-la! 
         Now you say it.
Who are you guys? Are you members of the Shinra, Inc.?
No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra.
...that's how it is.
I don't believe you! Get out of here!
Great...
Look at that!
Be careful Mr. Dolphin!
Hey! Hold on, we're coming!
This is bad... You don't think she's dead, do you?
Priscilla!!
Nope... she's not breathing...
Hey, that's it!
Young man, CPR, now!
Mouth to mouth!?
Cloud, hurry!
But,... she's just a girl.....
Cloud, what are you going to do?
What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you.
Guess I gotta do it...
Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her.
Hurry up and do it!
Uh... ugh...
Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?
Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while.
Hey, come in for a while.
I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla.
You all must be tired. If you want some rest, stay here.
Make yourselves at home.
Want to rest?
Yeah...
...That reminds me.
You again?
...Who are you?
...You'll find out soon. ......But more importantly, 
5 years ago...
5 Years ago... Nibelheim?
When you went to Mt. Nibel then, Tifa was your guide, right?
Yeah.... I was surprised.
But where was Tifa other than that?
...I dunno.
It was a great place for you two to see each other 
again.
...You're right.
Why couldn't you see each other alone?
...I don't know. I can't remember clearly...
Why don't you try asking Tifa?
...Yeah.
Then, get up!
Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud!
Tifa...
When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?
...We saw each other, right?
The other time.
No... it was 5 years ago. I don't remember.
But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick.
I heard that girl regained consciousness.
Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy 
all of a sudden...?
Seems like something's goin' on up there!
Does this have something to do with the Shinra?
Are you all right now?
Umm... thanks for helping...
I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc. ...
That's all right.
I'll give you something SPECIAL!
It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?
What's that music? It sure sounds lively.
I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra 
president.
Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects.
Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they 
were small.
But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped 
shining here, and the water got polluted...
I was raised on that story amd hate Shinra so much, I could die!
You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, 
too?
What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?
Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?
We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the 
tower?
No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the 
tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!
But... you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me!
High voltage tower.......
I guess this means Cloud'll be allright.
Yeah, better leave it to Cloud!
We're counting on you, Cloud
Hey!!
Wait a second!
That looks like a Shinra soldier.
Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of 
Shinra, Inc.!
Don't you just hate this?
You're probably right.
Wait a minute.
Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump 
like that!
Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps 
for me.
Here!! This is for you, Cloud!
A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?
Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll 
jump you to the top of the pole!
Jump to the top of the pole?
See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, 
you can climb to the top of the town.
Good luck Cloud! If you make it, we'll follow you.
Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet.
You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?
Hey! You still dressed like that!? Come 'ere!
Here!! Get in the room!
Today's the big day when we welcome President Rufus! Hurry up 
and change!
It's the Shinra uniform.
There's Shinra soldiers all around. Better not try anything 
dumb...
Quit yappin'! Hurry up!
Brings back memories...
Quit yappin'! Hurry up!
A Shinra uniform...
I was so proud when I first put it on.
I wonder when it was...
...I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore.
Wow! You look good in it!
You remember the Greeting procedure, right!?
...the look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show 
you again!
Do just like we do.
Commander! We'll help too!
This is how to do it.
We'll sing too!
All right! Show 'em!
Now, march! This's the Welcoming March!
Then! I'll sing along with you!
Quietly--!!
Aaah!
Aaah!
Hey, come on now.
Now!
Keep in step with the soldier next to you and march smoothly!
Once you're all in step, shoulder your gun!
Got it?
Good! Make sure you do well at the real parade!
Rufus has arrived! Preparation completed!
All right, show time! Don't disgrace yourselves!
Begin the Welcome Parade!
Oh no! No one's here!
Late---!?
Hey! Rookie! It's because you're running around like that!!
Captain! We'll take a short cut!
Right!
Good idea.
Get over here!
All right! You first!
What the hell was that soldier doing?
I don't know.
Are the points up?
Well, it's so-so.
Hmm...
Better send that soldier something.
Good! We made it.
Oh! President Rufus!
Hey! Line up and shut up.
Don't make a move!
How's the job?
What happened to the Airship?
The long range airship is still being prepared.
It should be ready in about three more days. Gya haa haa!
Even the Air Force's Gelnika?
.....Gya haa haa!
Stop that stupid horse laugh.
Things are different than when father was in charge.
Gya...
Is the ship ready?
Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly.
What a disaster.
Heidegger was really irritated...
The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't 
find him.
Man in the Black Cape?
He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our 
soldiers.
He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around 
that it was Sephiroth.
Attention! Dismissed!
Hey! Hey you! You messing with the army?
You're too lazy!! No break for you!!
Get over here!
This is the military, soldier! You orders for today are to send 
off President Rufus at the dock!
I'll keep drilling you until it's time!
I'll help, sir!
Me too, sir!
All right!! Line up in order and show me your final pose!
Today's command is Formation!
Remember it!
Ready!?
Junon Military Send Off, BEGIN!
All right! Now you try it!
So you got it?
All right! Don't mess up during the real thing!
Commander! What's today's special pose?
Huh? ...I haven't decided yet.
All right, rookie! I'll let you decide!
Show me your best move!
Let's see... My best move is...
Woo-----ow!
That's awesome!
All right! We'll go with that as today's special!
Practice it!
Yes sir!!
Yes sir!!
Well then! Meet at the dock! Don't be late!!
Attention! Dismissed!!
All right, it's time!
President Rufus... has now arrived!
Ten... HUT!
This is it!! Junon Military Reception--!
Do it right--- Do it with enthusiasm...! Ready...!
Well done.
Keep up the good work for Shinra, Inc.
Gya haa ha...!! Here's a special bonus for you!!
A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!
Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, Cloud and his 
friends will show up, too.
We'll crush them as soon as we find them!
We can't have them get in our way.
Leave it up to me, sir! Gya haa ha!
I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh...
Gya......
All right! Dismissed!
That was close.
Heidegger's been really edgy lately.
Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation.
Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too.
Hey--! I thought you were dismissed!
We've got some cleaning to do! Hurry up!
We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent.
...even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms...
I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?
The new President's probably the same.
He's just gonna order us around anyway.
Umm.... It's me, Aerith.
Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?
...I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big.
That was REALLY something.
Hey, do you think I could get on it?
...keep hoping.
Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!
Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!
It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.
...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.
Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.
It won't do any good trying to stop me!
All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
Hey, get to work!
Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!
If we do good, we could get promoted!
Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!
...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.
Uniforms, soldiers, war. I hate 'em all.
They take away the things and people you love...
I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?
You're right!
Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir! Hee hee....
...Cloud. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a 
little.
Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not...
Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!
A seaman's gotta have umph!
I got just the perfect this! 'Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink 
for seamen!
Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor.
This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha!
Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?
Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.
When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. 
Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan...
....... ...It's me. Red XIII.
I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.
Humans only look at appearances anyway.
Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.
It's pretty hard standing on two feet...
Hey, Cloud, did you see Barret?
I hope he's not doing anything stupid...
Look, Cloud. It' Rufus and Heidegger.
They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em...
Ummmmmm..... Gmmmmmm.....
How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that?
Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge....... Jessie.....!
Gggggggh.... Ggggh.....! Ggggggggghhh!!
God!! I can't take it anymore!
I'm gonna settle things here and now....
Emergency alert! Reports of a suspicious character found! Those 
not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
I repeat. Suspicious character found on board! Those not on 
detail, search the ship. Report when found!
Damn, did they find us?
Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean.... Tifa and the 
others!?
Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!
Everyone all right!?
You all right!?
Huh?
Everyone's here... right?
Hey, wait.
You don't think that suspicious character is....
Sephiroth!?
Really!?
How the hell am I supposed to know!?
....Let's find out.
It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?
.....Sephiroth.......
........All right, let's go!
....the Engine Room... a suspicious..... character...
No... there's no way.... that...... not a human..... That 
thing's not human.....
Is it........ Sephiroth?
No... not Sephiroth!
........After a long sleep...
...the time...
...time has....... come.....
Look, Cloud!!
Sephiroth! You're alive!
........Who are you?
You don't remember me!? I'm Cloud!
Cloud...
Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
...the time..... is now......
What are you saying!? Be more...
I've seen this somewhere... before.
...Jenova. The arm of Jenova.
Jenova... With this thing?
So it WAS Sephiroth.
He said something about it being time for something.
......Time...is now?
Hmmm... I don't get it.
Hey, Cloud. Can you explain it to us?
I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.
Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could 
become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago.
Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.
And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.
He was carrying Jenova with him.
...This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the 
Promised Land with his mother, Jenova.
....I guess that's about it.
Dock workers-- We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. 
Prepare for docking.
Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore...
Sephiroth..... is alive...
The Promised Land.... Does it really exist...?
Damn! Sure is hot here!
But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this 
sailor suit.
Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor
suit. He looked so cute.
.....What'ya mean 
 ?
Right... well, uh...
Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?
Right, Cloud?
Ahhh.... You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most 
comfortable, so shu'up!
Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.
I'm going on ahead.
Hmmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around 
wastin' time.
I'm going to skip this resort!
...puff...puff...
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
All right. We'll take a break here and then head off.
Don't wander too far off.
I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
It looks like my mane got messed up.
I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
What a long boat ride that was!!
Hmmm...... Good work everyone.....
Gya, Heh, heh..., ha!! Hurry up with that!
Yes, sir!!
I heard Sephiroth was on board.
.....Yes.
And it seems Cloud and the
others were on board, too.
....Yes.
They all slipped through...... You messed up big this time, 
Heidegger.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Is that all you can do...?
Give one word answers and apologize for everything?
Ready for departure, sir!!
.....Do something. I'll be expecting results.
Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!
Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents in that plane and I'll 
put one in your head!
Da plane, da plane!! That's something you'll never be able to do 
in your lifetime.
So you just watch from a distance... and wish.
He's quite handsome, isn't he?......
Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He 
even looks good in a double-breasted suit.
Rufus complimented me on my job!
Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!
I mean it. I'm really gonna quit!!
Heidegger's such an idiot!!
And Rufus, acting all big!!
God, that sure felt good....
Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.
Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!
Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the 
transport ship.
That's tough for both of us.
What a fluffy bed...... feels so great....
...SNORE...SNORE...
Geez my lower back's killing me!
Y, yes...sir!!
How do you do! I'm the Manager.
Nice to meet you.
Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night.
Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself.
Say, aren't you bored?
Oh, really? I'm a little bored.
Come on, back to work now!
Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.
What do you want to know?
Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the 
city.
If you're not looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.
Wait a minute. I'm going to look for my guidebook.
It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a 
prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.
Come on!! I don't care about that.
If you want a good time, come to the beach! There are lots of 
beautiful women.
You wouldn't happen to be... rich?
You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking.
But I'll tell you just in case.
After relaxing in Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a 
rich and exciting place to play!
I thought so.
Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.
Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an 
amusement park.
But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains 
and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.
But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.
We're all headin' over to the Gold Saucer now.
We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races.
Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.
Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year.
I'm sick of surfing.
You want drink? Iz ok. You take time.
...huff...puff... I can't stand hot places...
......HIC... Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.
I really like this town.
You could walk around nearly naked, and no one'd look twice at 
you.
Hey! I thought you'd drop by.
( That's 1,2... 4 fishes all together... not bad.
Come on... please. If you don't buy from me... I can't make ends 
meet.
Shall we play our hand around here?
Not yet. Remember, no compromises.
You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.
But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.
Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to 
approach.
I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.
Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.
I heard. That big dog talks like a human.
That's cool... but it's weird.
Hm, that's interesting.
It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.
You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my 
will.
1, 2, 3, here we go!
Yeah, I'd like to hire a gorgeous chick and have a great time.
How about a 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made 
especially in Costa del Sol!
What's with YOU!!
Hey, is it........ you?
We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were 
such a playboy.
And a $#&^ murderer!!
Why can't I remember your name?
That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?
That's okay. We'll just keep on like we don't know each other.
I'm starting a new life in this town.
A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my mumbling! I 
sure envy you all just living outside with the sky as your ceiling.
You think you're good enough to go around bragging about who you 
are?
I don't wanna hear it! Heh, no more mumbling from me!
From now on, I'm starting a new life!
I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks lately and is 
pretty depressed.
Hurry up and get out of here!
I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life.
Uh uh!
Hmmmm!?
Marlene! You ok?.....
Dad'll wear this when I go to see you.
Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, awright?
Uggh! I feel God awful! Oh!! You!
Weren't you the one with that big sailor?
What's the matter?
Listen to this...
All of a sudden, this big sailor just busts in here, and takes 
over the restroom.
He's been in there moaning ever since.
I don't know what I'm gonna do..
I don't know.
Wrong guy? It puts us in a bad situtation. That guy's taken over 
the john.
And he hasn't even paid his hotel bill yet.
Ah... if you're checking in, would you pay his bill, too?
Yo, Cloud! Still too early, ain't it?
What now? Call it a night?
200 gil a night.
Oh! Cloud!!
Look, look at that!
Hm...?
Is that man over there, Hojo?
Go over and talk to him.
Not a bad view....
What're you looking at?
That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here. Go 
talk to him!
God!! What do you want?
(Hey, who do you think you are?)
Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you.
(What's his problem?)
Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!
Professor... someone's here to see you, sir.
I'm busy right now.
.....But. Too bad.
Oh, I remember you all now.
Yes, yes. I remember now.
It's been a long time, Cloud.
Hojo.....
Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.
....What are you doing?
It should be obvious. I'm getting a tan.
Answer me!
Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal.
You mean Sephiroth?
Did you see him?
I see..... Ha! Ha!
What is it?
Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis.......
Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?
Or that you had to visit some place?......
I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at!
To beat him and put an end to all this!
I see...... This could be interesting.
Were you in SOLDIER? ....Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my 
guinea pig?
Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?
Stop, Cloud! I know how you feel, but you mustn't.
Ha! Ha! Ha!....
Say, aren't you the 'Ancient?'
I'm Aerith. The least you can do is remember my name.
I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo.....
I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me.
Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?
You didn't know? She died.
......I see.
Professor Hojo....
Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have 
the same blood?
......mumble....mumble..... head west....
He's mumbling slowly.... That must mean he's hiding something!
.................
Hey! Answer us!!
.......It's no use. It's no go.
He never takes off his lab coat even in thie heat. I guess 
that's the mark of an intellectual.
I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!
Yipes! Help!!
....breath.... breath...! Kind of takes your breath away, don't 
it!?
If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some 
'Soft.'
At least that's what they always say, don't they?
Be prepared, and you'll never fear.
Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! 
Pretty good, huh?
Whew!
Hey!
You're actually talking to me.
What is it?
I just passed a guy in a black cape back there.
I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he 
ignored me!
Sephiroth....
There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?
Let's hurry on.
Wha? Oh, it's you.
There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates 
this bridge.
Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.
The shack is here!! (^^);
Ok, then....
OW!! Sure is tight in here...
Come on, Cloud, don't let it get to you. Let's see... this is 
it.
Maybe if I turn this...
...something should happen.
How cute!!
Yes!! ....how cute.
What should we do?
Times are tough... I'm taking the
treasure.
Oh! Cloud! Your hair looks like a
Chocobo!
Cloud......
It's got nothing to do with us. Let's just leave it.
Cloud......
Hey! How'd you ever wind up around here?
Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!
Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal 
mining town!
They say there were more jobs than you could shake a...
Well, you get the picture!
Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer... 
everything's out of work.
Got no job... I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left 
for me is to just live in this hole all day.
Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.
They kick you out of another town or somethin'?
You destroy everything you touch.
You got a lot of balls comin' back here!
Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into 
a garbage heap!
Why doncha say something!?
Or did ya forget what you done here already?
...I'm sorry....
^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort.
Don't waste your time talkin' to the Techno-freak!
You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was... destroyed...
YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
The next train's coming in soon.
Grandpa used to be a coal train engineer.
He still can't kick his old habits from then.
Get out of the way!!
The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by 
collecting junk!
Please buy something! Anything will do!
What do you want?
Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station!
The Roadway'll take you to the Gold Saucer.
It don't mean much to the poor folks though...
If you want to survive, then you're gonna need some of my 
weapons.
I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that 
right?
Really...? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading 
towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.
I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, '0' 
oughtta be perfect.
Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
Because of them...... ugh my husband got into that accident.... 
He used to be such a strong man...
How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost 
everything...?
To hell with the Mako reactor!
Barret, what happened?
Sorry.
What happened?
My hometown used to be around here.
What do you mean, 'used to'?
It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.
But how could those people say those terrible things?
An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
Corel was always a coal mining
town.
It's so dusty, but calm and so poor... a real small town, this 
one.
That's the first time I ever heard the word 
 
mentioned since that time...
What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne.
I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to 
talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!
Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and 
theirs before them, risked their lives for it.
We have no right to throw it all away so easily!
But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of 
the times.
Right, everything is Mako, now.
It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your 
livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed.
Listen. Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.
I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!
But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!
Dyne... you've got to understand.
That's how the Corel Reactor was built.... and completed.
We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.
Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.
All the townspeople........ All my relatives......... 
Everyone...... Everything......
Shinra troops? What for!?
There was an explosion at a reactor.
Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a 
rebel faction.
That's so terrible!
Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't 
forgive myself.
Never should have gone along with the building of the reactor...
Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra 
made back then.
That's way... that's why I get so pissed off!!
Not only did they take advantage of me... But I lost my wife, 
Myrna, too...
Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and 
get on!
Ride the Ropeway?
Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...
Welcome to the Gold Saucer.
Welcome to the Gold Saucer.
Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase 
a lifetime pass for 30000 gil.
Thank you very much.
If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the 
park... as long as you don't lose it.
Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must 
pay with GP.
Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold 
Saucer.
GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the 
Chocobo Races.
Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful.
Please enjoy yourselves.
Wow! Let's have fun!
I know this isn't the right time to do this.
Hey, Barret, cheer up!
I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes'
leave me alone.
Really? That's too bad.
Let's go!
...whisper... whisper... (Wasn't that a little harsh, Aerith!?)
...whisper... whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)
...whisper... (You think so...?)
Of course!
We're gonna go play...
So PLAY! ...messin' round #@^%$!
Don't forget we're after Sephiroth!
...I think he's mad.
He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now.
What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?
Geez, you're a real bummer. Why don't you leave us alone?
We put on a really unusual show here. It's not on today, but 
come back again sometime and see it.
Hey boy.
Boy...
How is it? You having fun?
Mmm, so you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy.
My name's Cloud. And stop calling me boy.
Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio.
Just call me 'Dio'.
.........(Not even listening)
By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?
Ha ha ha.... that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not 
good to lie. You can't fool me.
Why d'you ask me?
Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had 
a 'Black Materia.'
I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both 
about the same age.
Did he happen to have... a Black Cape...
Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.
Where did he go!?
Ha ha ha, I have no idea.
Well then.
I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy.
You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display 
there.
Ha, ha ha.
We have to be careful of these steps.
What...? A lot of things...
First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess 
on the attacks...... mumble, mumble.....
Hear the rules for this attraction?
This attraction, Shooting Coaster
is
While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things 
are going PHEW PHEW amd you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, 
isn't it?
Oh, to shoot, hit the O button. And, the Bar that's shown on the 
left side of the screen is the Power Meter.
When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll 
only go BRM and become weak. So be careful.
Also, if you're in the Top 3 you'll get on the Wall of Fame.
This attraction costs 10 GP.
Would you like to see the Wall of Fame?
You'll receive a prize if you get more than 3000 points. So good 
luck.
Welcome. This attraction is 3 GP.
Shall you be riding this evening?
Welcome. Thank you for coming to the Ghost Hotel.
Uuuuuuuuuugh.....
For reservations, please step up to the counter.
Uuuuuuuuuuugh...
It's our most popular employee, Mr. Hangman.
Welcome!
It's 5 GP a night. Would you like to stay?
I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again.
Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?
How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A 
happy future!
Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction!
Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's...
You can only read the future?
You kidding!? I can find missing things, missing people, 
anything!
Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?
Sephiroth, right?
Okay, here goes!!
...Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune.
Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen 
by summer. ...wait... what's this?
Huh? Let me try again.
Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is... blue?
...Forget it.
Wait, wait give me another chance!
Wait! Let me try it again!
...What the!?
What?
What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear.
I don't know if it's good OR bad...
This's the first time I ever got something like THIS.
Then shall we?
What are you talking about?
As a fortune teller, I can't help but think about this.
If I don't see what it leads to, I won't be able to relax. 
That's why I'm going with you!
What are we going to do, Cloud?
I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!
H... hey!
Come now, no running!
They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the 
attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'.
They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square 
games or at the Chocobo Races.
You have (number of GP).
Exchange your GP for prizes here. Want to exchange?
Nope. I'm not quitting until I clear this!
Hyuuuu, BAM, BAM, BAM...
Oh man, I just gotta shout.
...Don't worry 'bout me. Go ahead and play.
I get so caught up in these...
Back there...
Hmmm...I'm impressed. Thanks for showing me it.
Here, take this.
Go---!! Do it----!! That's it----!!
Welcome to Chocobo Racing.
I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only.
You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For 
example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy three boxes.
A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 Chocobos.
For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase 
combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5.
You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo.
Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it 
in all of your combinations.
For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.
No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. 
It all comes down to insight and luck.
We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right?
In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is 
highest and C's the lowest.
When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A 
rank tickets.
Of course, the higher the rank, the better the item ticket. Hey, 
maybe I'll become a Chocobo 
jockey!?
You can become one if you own a Chocobo... and have some 
connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any 
connections.
Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?
That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condtion and strengths.
Hmm, if you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's 
easy...
Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the 
Chocobo's strength.
but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's 
personality.
If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect 
other things.
Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?
This Chocobo Race has Virtual devices on the course.
They show natural scenery during the race that really doesn't 
exist.
You pick which Chocobo will finish first and second here.
And then buy the appropriate tickets.
And if the ticket you purchased is a winner, you'll receive a 
ticket for an item that will be listed on the panel.
You can exchange your tickets for items of GP at the exchange 
counter to the right of the entrance.
!!
Mm!?
Dead.....
What!? Why?
Cloud!? Where are you going?
Did Sephiroth do this!?
No... it's not him... They're all shot... Sephiroth would never 
use a gun...
Ugh, ugggh.
Hey, what happened!
Ugh... ugh... a man with a gun... on his arm....
It can't be!?
Hold it right there! And stay quiet!!
Did you guys do this!?
N... no, it wasn't us!
I must've been wrong...
Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly.
H... hey!
Hold them!
That's as far as you go.
Wait, listen to...
Cloud...
Gateway to Heaven.
One more to go.
Yes.
Hey! Pay attention!!
There's no need to listen. Pay for your crime down below!!
Do it!
Yes.
You all right?
Where are we?
A desert prison... Corel Prison...
A desert prison?
Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert... surrounded 
entirely by quicksand.
I heard that once you get in, you never get out....
But, there was one special exception...
Hey!! Barret!!
Barret...
Did he really.....
Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with.
Jes' leave me alone....
Whew! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous...
Cloud, what should we do? Barret's not his normal self.
This one's been shot too...
Wo-ho! Welcome to Corel
Prison.
Ha ha ha
I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely 
dangerous.
It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave, it'll 
swallow ya.
I hear tell, some of them never make it out... the best thing is 
to stay out of the desert entirely.
Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not a one of 'em will tell 
you the truth.
Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of 
them.
This place is heaven.
This place is heaven.
This place is heaven.
Man with a gun on his arm?
Never heard of him.
Never heard of him.
Never heard of him.
You wanna see the Boss?
Go Southwest and you'll meet him.
You'll meet him.
You'll meet him.
Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk.
Don't walk.
Don't walk.
There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. 
No way.
No way.
No way.
This elevator will talk you to the top...
But, you gotta be picked a s Chocobo racer, first.
Want to enter the Chocobo Race?
You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life!
Then go get permission with the boss of this place.
Who's the boss?
You don't even know that? Oh man.
You new? Then go and pay your respects to Mr. Coates.
Never seen your faces 'round here before. Goin' up?
Heh heh! You sure got guts!
You don't seem to understand how things work down here.
This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya 
scrubs.
The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race.
But, it's not as easy as you rookies think.
Of course, if you got the boss's premission it'd be a different 
story but, YOU'll never get that!
Ha ha ha ha.
Didn't I tell you not to come here!?
Ju..... just hold on for a second! We just want to talk! You'll 
understand if you just hear us out!
Didn't want none of ya to get involved...
Hey that's Cloud's line! '...It's too dangerous, I can't let you 
get involved...' blah, blah, blah...
Yeah. We're already involved in this.
We saw you and hurried here. So come on Barret, just tell us 
what's going on.
You guys...
I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man 
with a gun-arm. ...Was that you?
There's another.... another man that got a gun grafted inta one 
of his arms... It was four years ago....
Barret! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's 
Shinra soldiers!
What!!!?
What the hell happened? .......
Hey, Barret! It's not over yet!
Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!
Barret! Dyne! Protect the village!
Hmp!! Old man!!
C'mon, Barret! We gotta hurry!
Krggh!!
Barret!! You stay here!!
Kyaa haa, ha!!
You can shoot all day and never hit them with an aim like that.
Shu'up!!
Haa, ha, ha!! Stop playing around and cover me!!
Watch out!!
Dyne!! Hang on!!
Lissen to me!! You're comin' back the the village, hear!!?
Yeah... I ain't lettin' go...
You're comin' back... Everyone's waitin' for ya...
Eleanor... and Marlene... They all waitin' on us...
From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more.
...I was depressed for a while.
But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted 
in.
Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took 
everything away...
Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got 
the same operation as me.
But, his was the left arm...
.....
But... Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?
Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too.
He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.
...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can 
rest in peace.
An' that's why, I gotta go alone.
Do whatever you want... Is that what you want to hear?
Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm 
gonna have nightmares.
Barret, this isn't the end.
Weren't you going to save the Planet?
Shit! Tifa, you oughtta know by now.
...That's all right. I'm not so different from you.
That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret.
So there it is, Barret. So I guess it'll be Barret, me, 
and......
...Dyne .... Is that you?
Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years...
A voice I'll never forget...
I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday...
I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.
Listen to me Dyne. I want to...
What's that? ...I hear her voice.
......?
I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate 
your rotten guts.
That's why I didn't hunt you down...
I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me.
But... What're you doin' in a place like this?
Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?
....Why!? The hell do you care for!?
Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people 
of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?
I don't CARE what the reason is!
All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left 
is a world of despair and emptiness...
........
You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you.
'Cause I want to destroy everything.
The people of this city.
This city itself.
The whole world!
I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor...... 
Marlene......
Dyne, Marlene...... Marlene's still alive.
........?
I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure.
That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end.
That's when I found her..... ...found Marlene.
...
She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?
So...... she's still alive...
All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight.
What!?
Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her.
Dyne.... are you insane!?
Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?
Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!
Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.
Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!
Barret!
Cloud, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!
Back!!
...it wasn't just my arm...... back then....
I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where I went 
wrong...
Dyne..... I don't know either, man.
Is this the only way... we can resolve this?
I told you... I... I want to destroy everything...
Everything... This crazy world... Even me...
An' what about Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?
Think about it... Barret... How old was Marlene back then...?
Even if I did go to her now... she wouldn't even know me...
And what's more... Barret....
These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore...
......
Barret...
Give that pendant to Marlene... It was... Eleanors's... my 
wife's... memento...
All right...
...wow... Marlene's... already..... 4......
Barret.... Don't... make... .....Don't ever make Marlene..... 
cry...
Dyne...?
Dyne!
Dy--------ne!!
...Dyne. Me an' you were the same...
My hands ain't any cleaner.... I shouldn't be able to carry.... 
Marlene either....
Uuuuurrrrgghh!!!
You want somethin'?
I want to go up.
Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then 
win the Chocobo.....
Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak.
So, I got this instead.
Yeah, bull--!!
I want to go up.
R, right.
Did you kill Dyne?
You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing.
So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little.
Dyne didn't care who anyone was......
The hell do YOU know!!
R... ri.... right! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. 
S, s... sorry.
Then, will you get us outta here?
Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken.
I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here.
That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's help up there, in the 
Gold Saucer.
And, only one racer can go up at a time.
Say what!?
Nooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!
A rule's a rule. I can't change it.
If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I 
can't do that!
Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal 
with Dio.
Awright then.
Cloud, you go.
We'll wait down here.
Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!
Yes, good luck, Cloud.
Have you decided?
All you need now is a manager.
...and register and get a Chocobo...
Hi...... I happened to hear your story.
Ester?
I'll be your manager.
Well, I have nothing against it, but....
This is Ester. She may look kinda funny...
But there's no better manager in the races.
That's so rude...
Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud.
All right then, Cloud.
I'll send you up on the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the 
details.
Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You 
just concentrate on the race.
Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many 
different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals.
Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the 
money, some only for glory... And then there are people like you.
Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo.
Ummm... First use the [Select] button to choose either AUTO or 
MANUAL.
In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on 
its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it 
to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
You can't really help on this one.
But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow 
and you should be able to handle them.
When you're riding, use the Square button to Speed Up and the X 
Button to Slow Down.
But, it you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose 
its stamina really fast.
And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and 
right, use the O button to get a boost of speed.
Of course your stamina runs out faster though.
There are some bad-tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves 
and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.
For there kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on 
Manual and slow it down.
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second 
Chocobo cross the goal line,
Push the [Start] button to end the race.
You new?
Hi, Joe.
Hey, Ester, you're looking pretty as usual.
Thanks.
Let me introduce you, Cloud.
This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys.
Nice to meet you, Cloud.
If you're with Ester, then...
Right! He's an up and coming jockey.
He's only been down here for a day and already he made it up 
here!!
What!?
Oh, I see...
So what did you do down there?
Sorry... you're not supposed to ask about the past here...
Pretty interesting.... I have a feeling that we'll meet again.
Then, until we meet again, Cloud.
I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a 
while.
The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the 
next race, please proceed the the paddock.
I repeat...
Cloud.
Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race.
This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He won't lose easily.
Oh yeah... You know how to ride one?
Then, good luck.
Congratulations!! Now you're home free!
Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you when you 
won.
Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must have won. And 
won a victory that I am sure you earned.
I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you are victorious, I 
promise that you and all your friends will get a full pardon, and you will 
all be set free.
And also, by way of apology, I prepared a little gift for you to 
use on your journey.
Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a 
very busy man. Sincerely, Dio
A gift?
Cloud, isn't this great!? The assistant manager just stopped by 
and dropped off a 'buggy' for you!
Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem.
OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside.
P.S. I just recently met Sephiroth. He must have a lot of fans 
with boys your age.
Why don't you get his autograph? It seems he's headed toward the 
South of the river, towards Gongaga.
Sephiroth...
I guess this is goodbye.
Yeah. Well, if you ever get your
own Chocobo, come race again.
I'll take care of your registration
and everything. I'll see you again.
Is someone there?
Hey, Rude. Who do you like?
What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you 
like?
...........Tifa.
Hmmmm.......
That's a tough one.
But, poor Elena. She.... you......
No, she likes Tseng.
I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient...
What are they talking about?
It's so stupid!
They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is 
different.
Ah! Oh no!
They're here! They're really here!
Hmm... Then it's time...
Rude... Don't go easy on them even though they're girls.
...Don't worry, I'll do my job.
Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!
It's been a while.
Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.
That's sad.
I don't like being taken for a fool.
That's as far as you go.
...How could they know we were coming here?
They followed us...... But there weren't any signs of it. Then, 
that means......
A spy!? ...No way.
I don't even want to think that there's a spy....
I trust everyone.
A ruined reactor.
It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development.
.....Hmph! This isn't any good either.
You only get junky materia from junky reactors.
This reactor's a failure.
What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?
No, I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.
Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.
I just can't wait.
With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been getting a bigger 
budget.
I envy them.
But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid 
Heidegger ever use it?
.....
Oh... sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!
.....
Let's go!
...Big, large, huge materia?
An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?
Just what are the Shinra up to...?
A ruined reactor....
.............
Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband....
Huh..... did you want something?
People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors.
They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to 
get there.
...You want something?
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's 
safety. And, this is the result.
Oh... you here to shop?
It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find 
pieces of it left all over town.
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's 
safety. And, this is the result.
One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in 
it...
This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor 
explosion.
The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the 
Reactor was built. But, all it brought us was sadness...
Uh... need somethin'?
It's 80 Gil a night.
It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find 
pieces of it left all over town.
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's 
safety. And, this is the result.
One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in 
it...
You a traveller? Hey wait, that glare in your eye... you in 
SOLDIER?
Oh you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?
His name is Zack.
It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying 
that he didn't want to live in the country...
He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a 
Zack in SOLDIER?
Hmmm... I don't know.
Zack...
Young lady, you know him?
I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a 
girlfriend. Could that have been you?
That can't...
Zack...
What happened to you two?
Aerith...
What a shock..... I didn't know Zack was from this town.
You know him?
Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.
............
Zack.... SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud.
Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've 
never heard of him.
That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried 
because I heard he's been missing.
Missing?
I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never 
came back.
He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone 
else...
Hey? What's wrong?
I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel 
for his parents.
Are you... jealous? Hmm? Hmmm? Are you, Cloud?
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
Let's go, Cloud.
Zack......
Do you know him?
N, no, I don't know him!
Your face tells me differently.
I told you, I don't!
A, all right.
...........
That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining 
SOLDIER!'.
There were a lot of guys like that back then.
You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group 
like that.
I really respect you...
Don't be so humble!
Hard work pays off, huh.
Cloud, thanks for caring.
!?
Oh man... a breakdown? Now?
I am home! It is I, Nanaki!
Hey, Nanaki! You're safe!
Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!
...Nanaki?
Cosmo... Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet 
or the Ancients...
Red XIII seems different, doesn't he?
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?
Let me explain.
People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of 
Planet Life.
Ummgah! It's full capacity at present, so I'm afraid I can't 
let you enter.
They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in.
...Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in.
Who is Nanaki?
Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name.
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home.
So this is Cosmo Canyon... Quite a mysteious place.
Have you come to seek the 'Study of Planet Life'?
Yeah? I heard there's an awesome observatory here. I'd like to 
see it if I have a chance.
Oh yeah? What? The car broka down?
Why don't you look around Cosmo Canyon, while I fix the car?
Whoa!
Don't scare me like that. I almost fell over.
Yaay! Nanaki! Nanaki's back! It's all thanks to this flame!
This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle.' It has burned for 
generations.
It's a holy flame that protects this canyon.
I heard once, it only went out once, long ago.
The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really 
don't know much about it.
Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?
Yeah, thanks.
Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?'
A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit. 
...If you know when to stop.
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'.
It'll be 100 gil a night. Would you like to stay?
Hello. Looking for anything in particular?
Oh, welcome.
The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything 
here are replicas.
But that's all right. Some of them you really can use.
Where did I put it...? I know it's around here...
Bugenhagen sealed this door shut.
How'd he do that? With super glue?
Oh man, I'm so busy. I need more help. Mummer... complaint...
...num... yawn... Sir,... You... forgot..... your... ..change.
...num.... Yes, I'm coming.
Are you here to shop?
Oh... is that so... You're here to shop?
I'm sorry! We hardly ever get any customers so.... Oh, but I DO 
have confidence in our materia!
Oh... is that so.... then leave me alone and let me.... yawn.... 
sleep....
Here is where I was.... I mean, ...this is my hometown.
My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful 
canyon and the Planet.
My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father 
left her....... I am the last of my race.
Cowardly father?
Yes. My father was a wastrel.
And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect 
this place. My journey ends here.
Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!
Coming, Grandpa!
That's perfect. Why don't we take a break too? We can meet back 
here in a while, OK?
Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen.
He is incredible. He knows everything.
Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit.
Nanaki is still a child you see.
Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity.
So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of 
a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.
15 or 16!?
He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?
.......grandfather. I want to be an adult.
I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.
Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet.
To do that now would destroy you in the long run.
Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very 
stars from the great city of Midgar. You're seen it, haven't you?
Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose 
perspective.
When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that 
you know absolutely nothing.
.....When the planet dies?
Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But 
it's not long off.
How do you know this?
I hear the cries of the Planet.
What's that?
Tha sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, 
planets are born, and die.
What was that?
Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet.
Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer.....
They have come here on a journey to save the planet.
Why don't you show them your apparatus?
Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!
But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him.
Bugenhagen!
Several odd looking people have come.
The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden.
He brought friends too. I'll go get them.
Cloud, please call one of them.
Only three people can fit in grandfather's machine.
Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your 
friends.
Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in.
Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then 
let's begin.
I'll stand there.
So pretty... It's just like the real thing!
Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory.
All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic
System.
Hey! A shooting star!
Wow, how wonderful.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it?
Well, let's get to the subject.
Eventually... all humans die. What happens to them after they 
die?
The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much 
everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their 
souls?
The soul too returns to the Planet.
And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In 
fact, all living things in the universe, are the same.
The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another 
and roam the Planet.
They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 
'Lifestream'.
Lifestream.... In other words, a path of energy of the souls 
roaming the Planet.
'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget.
A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are 
brought into the world.
Then, the time comes with they die and once again return to the 
Planet...
Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the 
world.
I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this.
......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life.
If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed...
Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within 
nature.
When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it 
can't accomplish its true purpose.
You're talking about Mako energy, right?
Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it.
Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into 
Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away.
In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet...
The story of the planets... and those who lived with them....
You want to know more? Then you must listen to the words of the 
elders.
I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things.
About the Cetra... And the Promised Land...
I'm...... alone..... I'm all alone now...
But I'm..... we're here for you, right?
I know. I know, but... I am the only.... Cetra.
Does that mean we can't help?
I wonder how many years it's been... Gosh, it brings back 
memories......
Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born...
I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the 
Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate...
Biggs... Wedge... Jessie...
Now they're all gone... died for the planet.
...Really? To save the planet?
We all... we all hate the Shinra...
Do I even got to go on?
Will they...... ...will they ever forgive me?
...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing.
If there's anything I can do, to save the planet... or the 
people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it!
I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I 
don't care..... let 'em decide for 'emselves.
Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!!
Again.... Again.... AVALANCHE's born again!
Cloud...
Bonfires are funny, aren't they?
They make you remember all sorts of things.
You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago...
.........It's nothing.
No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask...
What is it...?
It feels like... It feels like you're going far away...
You really, really are..... you... right?
......Long ago.
...When I was still very small. We were all around this flame...
No, never mind...
What happened?
It's about my parents.
When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy...
And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is 
full of anger...
...You really can't forgive your father...?
Of course. He... left mother for dead.
When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving 
mother and the people of the Canyon!
...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see.
...?
The place may be dangerous.
Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?
Ho Ho Hoooo
Are we all set?
Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?
All right. Come in, come in.
Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?
What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that!
You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right 
behind you.
Ho Ho Hoooo.
Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain 
battle.
A certain battle?
The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't 
return to the Lifestream...
We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo.
As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon.
It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they 
attacked though here, we wouldn't have stood a chance.
..........
Let's move on.
This warrior went through the cave all alone.
Fighting attackers one after another...
Grandpa........ That warrior....
Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there.
What is this.....?
Grandpa, is he...!?
After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air.....
This... can't be!!
Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived.
Nanaki, you have grown strong too.
.......Oh yeah?
Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here...
Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here.
This is...
...The warrior who fought against the Gi.
He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon.
But he was never able to return to town...
Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto.
...That... That's.... Seto?
Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. ...To the protect 
this Canyon.
Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to 
stone......
Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us.
And he continues to protect us, even now.
Even now...
You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone, 
risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon.
That is your father, Seto.
That..... that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?
Ho Ho Hoooo... She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep 
this cave shut.
They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul.
Thay said we should forget about this cave.
.........
Cloud..... Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?
Nanaki, I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the 
others.
Grandpa!?
Listen, Nanaki.
Cloud says they are trying to save the planet.
Honestly, I don't think it can be done.
For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only 
going to postpone the inevitable.
Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish.
But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately.
I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do.
As a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in 
misery...
No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?
Am I just wishing against fate?
I am too old to do anything about it...
This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo.
That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake.
Grandpa...
I wanted to show you your real father before you left...
I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show 
you.
Grandpa... don't talk like that. I don't want to think of 
life... without you.....
Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life.
Grandpa! You must live!
I'll see to it.
I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back 
to tell you.
Nanaki...
I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto!
I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, 
Grandpa...
That's... Seto's..... Seto.....
Seto... Fa... Father....
They said they finished fixin' the buggy.
Shall we get giong?
So this is it, Red XIII...
That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...
Wait for me! I'm coming too!
Mmm?
Cloud. Please look after Nanaki.
What happened?
I think I grew up a little. That's
what happened!
What---!!
This was all supposed to be burnt down, right?
I thought so.
Then why...? My house is still there too...
...something's strange?
I'm not lying!
I remember... the intense heat of the flames...
Hi, welcome.
It'll be 100 gil a night. Is that all
right with you?
This town was supposed to have burnt down five years ago.
What the hell is going on?
Sir, don't say such awful things.
I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened.
You're lying...
EXCUSE ME..... That's so rude...
If you're going to talk like that to me, I'm going to have to 
ask you to leave.
Nice town, huh?
We've been in business here for a long time....
...You're lying.
Do you have anything to do with this town?
I was here until I was 14 and I don't remember you.
It's not nice to lie!!
...nothing.
Oh yeah...?
A man in a black cape!?
He has a tattoo of the number '12'. Mmm? He has something.
Can....... you...... hear? The... voice... of... Se... phi... 
ro... th.......
What is it?
Oh, really. Then, it'll help me too.
I lived in this house until I was 14...
No, but this town was burned down.
Are you sick... saying those things?
Get out of here!
...must..... get..... it... and bring... to... Se... phi... 
roth....
Then... become... one... with... Se... phi... roth...
This guy's number '5'...
He has a tattoo of the number '11'...
...must.......go... Reun... ion...
Tattoo number '4'
...Where... are... you...? Great... Se... phi... roth...
...................
....Re.... union.
.........ion
The... Great... Se... phi..... roth... is... near.....
In... side...... inside... the Mansion...... Urrrrrrgh....... 
the great..... Sephi..... roth
Wooooo-----ooow...... He's... calling...... Sephiroth......... 
is......... calling......
Sephiroth!
Being here brings back memories.
Are you going to participate in the Reunion?
I don't even know what a Reunion is!
Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will rejoin the Reunion 
becoming a calamity from the skies.
Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an 
Ancient!?
...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate.
I will go north past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then 
follow...
...Reunion? Calamity from the skies?
What's that...!?
A rusty old rocket... Wonder what they'd make something that 
huge for?
Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge 
of it.
Who's the 'Captain'?
The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in 
their Space Program.
He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an 
accident...
Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming 
about going into outer space.
Did you see a man in a Black Cape?
A man in a Black Cape? Nope... don't know a thing about it.
Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were 
planning to launch the rocket.
That rusted old rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space 
Program.
This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets.
You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never 
got off the ground though.
A gun is a MAN's weapon! Ain't nuthin' else'll do!
Welcome to the Shanghai Inn!
It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?
Would you like something to drink?
Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's 
representative, so you should really talk with him.
......that's too bad. Please come again.
A drink will ease your heart...
...I'm in here.
Welcome! This is the Item Shop.
All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long.
My job's to make everyone laugh all over the world...
There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco..... This is cool.
Let's take it! OK, Cloud!
Um... may I help you?
No... We're just looking at it.
...If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The 
Captain should be in the Rocket.
I'm Shera. And what are your names?
I'm Cloud.
I'm Aerith.
Tifa. Nice to meet you.
Hmm.... So you're not with the Shinra.
I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program 
came.
......!?
President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so 
restless all morning.
Rufus!!?
What're you guys doin' here?
We heard the Captain was here.
Captain? I'm the Captain!
The name's Cid. Everyone calls me, 'Captain,' though.
What d'ya want?
Tiny Bronco?
Wow! Not bad for a kid.
Alright then, I'll explain it to you.
You know Shinra developed a lot of techological gadgets during 
the meaningless war, right?
Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons 
manufacturer.
Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine.
There was so much excitement about the thought of going into 
outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger.
They put a major budget into it and made prototype after 
prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26.
They chose the best pilot in Shinra-- no, in the world-- me. I 
mean, come on.
And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was 
goin' well...
But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. 
That's why they became so anal!
And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans.
After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got 
my damn hopes up... DAMN THEM!
Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was 
profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration.
Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for 
them!
Look at this busted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man 
in space with this.
Everyday, it tilts a little bit more.
At this rate, I don't know which will come first, this thing 
falling down or me gettin' outta here.
My last hope is to talk to the President......
Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program.
A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, 
too!
Tiny Bronco
You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished 
possession. I can't let you take it.
Excuse me.... Cloud?
Did the Captain say anything?
Nope...
Oh...?
^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?
We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!
I... I'm sorry.
Really, don't mind us.
Shut up! Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn 
TEA!
Arggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!
Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco!
An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?
Sheesh...!! What bad manners!
Sorry. It's our fault.
No, no. He's always like this.
Is it always like this...? Why is Cid so hard on you?
No... It's because of my stupid mistake.
I was the one who destroyed his dream...
What happened?
Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!
Even the moon'd get tired watin' around for your ass!
I'm... I'm sorry.
Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!
Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good no matter 
how many times you check that oxygen tank.
That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over.
But...
No buts!!
You're not stupid, so be more efficient!
I'm sorry.....
Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!
We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26.
Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!
Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!
All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!
Thanks, guys!
We're praying for your safety!
Instrument panel... all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch.
Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. 
Beginning countdown.
..........finally.
What the? What happened!?
Cid! We have an emergency situtation!
A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?
I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Hey, goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?
It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch.
Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?
I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test 
weren't satisfactory.
You stupid little ^$#^%!
It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT 
left when we blast off!
You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know 
that, doncha!?
I don't mind.
If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost 
done.
Almost done!? You're gonna die!
Cid, we must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!
Starting engine!
Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!
What are you going to do, Cid? If we cancel now, it'll be 
another six months until the next launch!
GODDAMMIT, Shera... you wanna make me a murderer?
Captain!
Shera!?
Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, 
it's all clear.
Come on, Shera... hurry up... You're gonna die...
30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown.
Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!
Cid! Forget about her. We won't make it in time!
What... what am I... What am I supposed to do...?
15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising.
Oh man, the moon... outer space... my dreams...
Ignite engine!
SH------------IT!
He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the 
mission, to save my life.
After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was 
canceled.
It's my fault his dream was destroyed...
That's why... it's all right. I don't care what the Captain 
says, I'll live my life for him.
Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!
I... I'm sorry.
Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for 
you!?
They're late... Where is Rufus...?
Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So Cid, how ya been?
Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on 
keepin' me waitin'!?
So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?
Hey-hey! I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you 
ask him?
^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!
Don't say 'fat'!
Hey-hey! Tea!
Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and... oh yeah, 
don't forget the lard!
What the.....! You got me all excited for nothing!?
Then, what'd you come here for?
I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco.
We're going after Sephiroth. But it seems like we're been going 
in the wrong direction.
But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to 
cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane...
&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny 
Bronco.
Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take 
the sky away from me too!?
Oh my...
You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were 
able to fly in the first place.
What!?
Uh, excuse me...
This way...
You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?
I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?
Hmm... Why do I have to do this...? I'm the head of the Space 
Program...
We'll be takin' that Tiny Bronco.
I've seen you somewhere before...
I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp!
Se... se... security!!
It won't stop!
Forget it! Get in!!
Shit!! The tail's been hit!
Emergency landing...
This's gonna be a big splash. Hold onto your drawers and don't 
piss in 'em!
She won't fly anymore.
Can't we use it as a boat?
$#&%! Do whatever you want!
Cid, what are you going to do now?
Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the 
town.
How 'bout your wife? How 'bout Shera?
Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her 
gives me the chills.
What're you guys gonna do?
We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get 
Rufus of the Shinra someday too.
I don't know about any of that, but...
What the hell!? Sign me up!
How 'bout it, everyone?
Of course, no problem!
Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!
Numskulls...?
Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has 
GOTTA be a numskull! I like it!
So, where we headed?
Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the 
Ancients.
Really!? ...Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?
Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'the 
wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?
Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the 
Ancients... that name bothers me.
Huh? Oh, another customer. You sure picked an out of the way 
place but...
But if it's the 
 you're looking for, you're too late. 
Don't have it.

Wh, what is this?
You can't do this!
The King
Oh, that was fun. Hey, let's go on the Gondola.
Two, please.
Here you are, two tickets.
Enjoy the sights of the Gold Saucer.
Wow, how nice.
Oh! Look, Cloud.
It's so pretty.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
.........first off, it bothered me how you looked exactly 
alike.
Two completely different people, but look exactly the same.
The way you walk, gesture...
I think I must have seen him again, in you...
But you're different.
Things are different...
Cloud...
I'm searching for you...
............?
I want to meet you.
But I'm right here.
I want to meet..... you.
I had fun tonight. Let's go together again.
You don't like being with me?
Oh, don't tease me like that!
I'm glad.
Next time we come, let's take our time and go on more rides.
Oh, look at the time. We'd better get going.
Hey? What's Cait Sith doing?
!!
Is that the... Keystone?
Hey! Cait Sith!
Here! The Keystone!
Well done.
Hey!
W, wait a second. I won't run or
hide.
Yes, I was a spy. I was hired by
the Shinra.
...I trusted you. I can't believe
you!
I couldn't help it.
How 'bout if we continue like
nothing ever happened?
No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but 
being a spy!
Then what are you goin' to do? Kill me?
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just 
a toy anyway.
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controllin' 
this toy cat from there.
So you're from the Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
Whoa, I can't tell you my name.
We're not gettin' anywhere.
See? I told you! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just 
continue our journey?
You think I'm jokin'!?
...Alright, yes, I am a Shinra employee.
But we're not entirely enemies.
...Something bothers me. I think it's your way of life.
You don't get paid. You don't get praised. Yet, you still risk 
your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me...
It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too 
good if things ended the way they are now.
.......And so on, and so on...
He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy.
We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon, get real!!
...just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference.
But I prepared something in case this happened.
Why don't you listen to this?
Papa! Tifa!
Hey! That's Marlene!
Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady...
...So, you have to do as I say.
...you're the lowest...
I didn't want to do this... using dirty tricks and taking 
hostages...
But this is how it is... no compromises. So why don't we continue 
on as we did?
Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it 
is so I'll tell you later.
Of course, we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to 
deal with that.
...Well, we're stuck... We'll have to do what he says.
I wonder if Marlene is all right... I wonder what happened to 
Mom.
What took you so long, Cloud?
Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take 
the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it.
Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?
I want to go! I'm going for sure!
Then see you later.
This is... the Temple of the Ancients...
I... I know... I feel it... the knowledge of the Ancients.. 
floating...
You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it 
with the strength of will.
For the future? For us?
What are you saying? Do you understand?
You're uneasy... But happy?
Because I'm here? I'm sorry... I don't understand.
I want to go inside!
Black........ Materia.....
Look......
Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
Hey! It's Tseng!
Tseng? Of the Turks?
Uh... I've been had.
It's not the Promised Land... Sephiroth's searching for...
Sephiroth? He's inside!?
Look... for yourself...
Damn...
Letting Aerith go was the start... of my... bad luck...
The President... was wrong...
You're wrong.
The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.
And, I'm not going to help.
Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won.
...pretty harsh. Sounds like something... you'd say.
The Keystone... Place it... on... the altar...
You crying?
...Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since 
we were little...
There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there 
are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me.
Let's put the Keystone in.
Words... feelings... So many of them here.
What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?
...Cloud! I know it's going to be tough, but...
Don't give up! We can do it!
nyum... nyum...
Phew! We finally caught up to you.
I'm sorry. You waited for me.
Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.
They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect 
this Temple.
Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.
Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because 
there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.
Please, talk to me!
No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid...?
Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?
Phew--- We did it!
Everyone all right? That sure took a lot out of us.
Oh no... Cloud. Come quick!
Hurry, this way!
It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.
No... not knowledge... consciousness... a living soul...
It's trying to say something.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
What?
What is it?
...Danger? An evil... consciousness?
...show? You're going to show me?
...What's going on?
Wait! Look! It's showing us!
Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?
...I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.
Be careful, Tseng.
Yeah...
Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?
Th... Thank you very much.
If I may be excused...
Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be...
Sephiroth!!
So you opened the door. Well done.
This place... what is it?
A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the 
Ancients...
I am becoming one with the Planet.
One with the Planet?
You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.
All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom... 
knowledge...
I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... It will 
become one with me.
...you can do that?
The way....... lies here.
Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.
For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, 
you will live again as a part of me.
Did you see it?
...I saw it.
...Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?
Almost there...
Sephiroth is here, right?
No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here.
I'm taking him out!
We're here too, you know.
I am the Time Guardian. Ye who seek the knowledge of the 
Ancients. I control the time, select your path.
Hey! It's locked.
No good. We have to catch it!
You must be tired.
Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back at these hard times 
and laugh.
Yeah. But it'll all be over soon!
The Guard that escaped with the key to the door moves on a set 
course.
Memorize the doors he enters and exits to figure out the pattern 
and catch him at an exit.
Oh yeah, oh yeah... you can jump down to the ramp below and to 
the left of the screen.
This is the room with the murals...
Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
So cold.
I am always by your side.
Come.
Splendid.
A treasure house of knowledge...
I don't understand what you're saying!
Look well.
At what!?
At that which adds to the knowledge of...
I am becoming one with the
Planet.
Mother..... it's almost time....
Soon..... we will become one.
How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
It's simple.
Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the 
injury.
The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the 
injury.
...What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the 
very life of the Planet?
Think how much energy would be gathered!
Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me.
All that boundless energy will be mine.
By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a 
new life forn, a new existence.
Melding with the Planet... I will cease to exist as I am now.
Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?
Injure... the Planet?
Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic... Meteor.
That'll never happen!
Wake up!!
Where are you! Sephiroth!
Wait! Cloud!
Cloud!!
Hey, Cloud!
Ha ha ha.... Black Materia.
Ha ha ha.... Call Meteor.
Cloud!! Get a hold of yourself!
Cloud...
I'm... Cloud...
How should I?
...I remember! I remember my way.
...Cloud.
Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?
...It's nothing so don't worry about it.
Right, Cloud! It's nothing.
Sephiroth got away.
...Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.
So this must be Meteor, right?
Is something going to fall from the sky?
...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.
The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.
It finds small drifting planets with its magic.
And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out 
entirely...
Sephiroth!?
Ha ha ha... It is not me.
Any sign of Sephiroth?
He disappeared.
What is this?
There's something written on it.
...B.l.a.c.k....... M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
Black Materia!!
Hey!
...Black Materia.
What should we do, Cloud?
Wait a minute. I'll ask!
I don't understand......
What?
Really!?
They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.
What do they mean?
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?
Then no one could take it.
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.
And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve 
a puzzle.
As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too.
Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller 
and smaller and we can take it out?
Yes, but there's one thing...
You can only answer puzzles inside the Temple.
So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
I see... the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out 
of the Temple so easily...
Let's just leave it, OK?
No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.
Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.
It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black 
Materia.
This place isn't safe.
So what are we going to do?
Hi, Cloud. This is Cait Sith.
I overheard the whole story!
Don't forget about me.
Everything you said makes perfect sense!
You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia.
And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do.
Everyone, please trust me.
All righty then! Leave it all to me!
Please hurry, you've got to get out of there!
I'll be waiting at the exit!
It's warm...
This isn't good...
Cloud... ...behind you.
Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's
me!!
I'll handle the rest!
Well, everyone.. Take care of yourselves!
Cait Sith...
Come on, Cloud... Say something.
I'm not good at this.
Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.
Why don't you read our fortunes?
Say, that's right... I haven't done it in a while, huh?
I'm so excited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me.
Now, what should I predict?
Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are!
That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!
Here I go!
This isn't good. I can't say it.
Poor Tifa.
No! Tell me!
I promise I won't get mad!
Is that so? Then I'll tell you.
Looks good. You are perfect for each other!
Aerith's star and Cloud's star! They show a great future!
Cloud, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher... I'll do whatever 
you want me to!
You just call me when it all happens!
Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.
This is the final, final farewell!
Be strong Cait Sith!!
She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel
so happy.
Owwww......
What happened?
I can still move more.
This must be it!
The Ancients sure did a great job making this.
I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed...
There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's 
only one me!
Don't forget me even if another Cait Sith comes along.
Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet...
That's the Black Materia...
I'll wait here.
As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.
Mmm?
Can you guys use it?
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power 
to use it.
You mean lots of Spiritual energy?
That's right.
One person's power alone won't do it.
Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's 
energy...
Oh yeah!
The Promised Land!
The Promised Land?
No, but...
Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.
...Ah, but I have.
I'm far superior to the Ancients.
I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge 
and wisdom of the Ancients.
I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the 
extinction of the Ancients.
And soon, I will create the future.
I won't let you do it! The future is not only yours!
Ha, ha, ha... I wonder?
Wake up!
Sh... shut up!
There, Cloud... good boy.
The... Noise...
Wa...... aaaa....aaa....
.......Well done.
Cloud, are you all right?
...I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...?
Wha... what did I do... tell me, Aerith.
Cloud... be strong, OK?
Urrrrrrgh... What have I done!?
Cloud... you haven't done anything.
It's not your fault.
I...! I'm----!
Cloud--!!
Oops! This looks like I came at a bad time!
I'm Cait Sith No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all!
Cloud, what are you doing!?
Everything is white...
What did I do? I don't remember anything...
My memory... since when...? If everything's a dream, don't 
wake me.
Cloud, can you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened.
Don't worry about it.
...I can't help it...
Oh...
Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?
And let me handle Sephiroth.
And Cloud, you take care of yourself.
So you don't have a breakdown, okay?
What is this place?
This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called 
Sleeping Forest.
It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.
That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the 
Cetra, like me, can do it.
The secret is just up here.
At least it should be. ...I feel it. It feels like I'm being led 
by something.
Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over.
Aerith?
Hmm........ She's thinking of interfering? She will be a 
difficult one, don't you think?
We must stop that girl soon.
You look like you was havin' a nightmare.
How are you feeling?
That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
You know, Cloud, Aerith is gone.
Everyone's out looking for Aerith.
......City of the Ancients. Aerith is headed there.
By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?
Hey, we're goin' too.
Only the Ancients, only Aerith can save us from Meteor...
Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aerith? 
If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
Sephiroth... already knows.
Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
Let's go, Cloud.
No.
I might lose it again.
If Sephiroth comes near me 
         I might...
Yeah, godammit! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black 
Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
My fault?
I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But, you don't even 
understand yourself.
But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this 
train we're on, till get to the end of the line.
Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you even going to settle up 
with Sephiroth?
No...
I'm afraid.
If this keeps up, I may go crazy!
I'm afraid...
Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...
Yo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya 
think really understand themselves?
People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.
But, they go on living. They don't run away... isn't that how it 
is?
Cloud... you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
What... am I supposed to do?
Pull out of here?
Pull out? ...To where?
Cloud...
Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time.
He has to decide this on his own.
You believe in Cloud... right?
......I'm afraid to find out the truth...? But...... why?
You awake?
Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until 
you woke up.
You sure do have good friends.
Cloud...
Hey, how are you?
I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?
You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?
Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is 
worry about it.
Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it 
happens, it happens.
I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to 
normal!
Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
But...
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
...You're... right. ......He's right, isn't he?
Come on, let's go and find Aerith...?
Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.
What do you want?
The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City.
Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went 
into the Sleeping Forest anyway.
We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the 
planet.
We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We simulate 
earthquakes by using bombs, and then check the sound waves given off by 
the tremors.
You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp.
Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you.
The girl in pink that just went in also used a Lunar Harp to get 
through.
Ask the guy in the tent below.
Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are 
stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that.
The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right 
now the forest is asleep and anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, it 
confuses. You can go in, but you may never come out...
But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a Black Cape went in. 
You think they'll be all right?
The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could 
excavate it for you if you want to.
It's not just the Lunar Harp you're after. We else are you 
having us dig for?
All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where 
you want to dig!
Now, the staff will dig here. The result of the dig will be 
placed in the town treasure box overnight.
Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable.
Shall we take a break here?
I feel it...
Do you know what TIME it is!?
Aerith is here. 
         ...and so is Sephiroth.
Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?
But how can you tell?
...It's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul.
Shit, Cloud, we can't be sittin' around on our asses.
...right. Let's hurry and find Aerith.
Aerith's voice...... Coming from there?
Aerith?
Cloud!
Stop!
Ugh... what are you making me do?
...Aerith.
This can't be real!
Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's 
energy.
All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for 
me over the snowy fields.
There I will become a new being by uniting with the planet. As 
will this girl…
...Shut up.
The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing.
Aerith is gone.
Aerith will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry...... or get 
angry......
What about us...... what are WE supposed to do?
What about my pain?
My fingers are tingling. 
         My mouth is dry. 
         My eyes are burning!
What are you saying? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings 
too?
Of course! Who do you think I am!?
Ha, ha, ha...... Stop acting as if you were sad.
There's no need to act as though you're angry either.
Because, Cloud. You are...
Because, you are...... a puppet.
I'm...... a puppet?
Everyone, listen to me.
I'm Cloud, ex-SOLDIER, born in Nibelheim.
I came to settle up with Sephiroth.
...What's going on?
I came here by my own free will... Or so I thought.
However...
...To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself.
...There is a part of me that I don't understand.
That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth.
If you hadn't stopped me, Aerith might've been...
...There's something inside of me. A person who is not really 
me.
That's why I should quit this journey.
Before I do something terrible.
But I am going.
He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed Aerith, and is 
now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive... Sephiroth.
I... I must go on.
...I have a favor to ask of you.
Will you all come with me?
...to save me from doing something terrible.
Well, we'll face it when that happens.
I don't know how Aerith tried to save the planet from the 
Meteor.
And I guess now, we'll never know.
But!
We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back 
before Sephiroth uses it.
Let's go.
I don't care / OK, let's 
go,
Sephiroth... I wonder which way he went?
...ugh.
Ey, hey! You alright?
Hmmm...
Sephiroth said to me... Head North......... ......past the Snow 
Fields......
Grandpa, wake up! We have a customer!
...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came.
Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one.
It's almost finished!
My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here...
I never should've bought him a snowboard.
...whimper..... weep.....
My husband left 20 years ago an still hasn't come back.
He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked 
with a check on the map...
The master is an experienced climber, you know.
I've heard that he knows every corner of the Great Glacier!
It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a
map.
If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd 
better take that map on the wall.
You heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off 
limits!
What luck! We came all this way... crap!
It's colder than usual today...
It's 200 gil, you wanna spend the night?
Phew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya.
Weapon?
Camera's ready!
Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.
2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the 
Planet.
The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at 
the Knowlespole.
Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?
Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a 
Planet-reading.
Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?
...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a 
conversation with the Planet...
It said something fell from the sky making a large wound.
Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet...
But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal 
itself, over many years.
Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal 
the Planet?
No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living 
things on this Planet becomes the energy.
The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to 
diminish the needed energy...
Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts.
Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its 
injury?
Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away 
the land... then the Planet...
The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, 
but...
Ifalna... Let's take a break.
I'm all right... When the Cetra... were preparing to part with 
the land they loved...
That's when it appeared!
It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead 
brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.
Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't 
any idea.
That's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis 
from the sky', as we call him, came.
He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and 
finally...... gave them the virus.
The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad... 
transforming into monsters.
Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole.
He approached other Cetra clans...... infecting them with... 
the virus...
You don't look well... Let's call it a day.
What is 'Weapon'?
Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?
Yes, Professor.
The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. 
That is the 'crisis from the sky'.
The Planet knew it had to destry the 'crisis from the sky'...
You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able 
to fully heal itself.
Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of its own 
will?
Yes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used.
A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and 
confined it.
The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to 
use it.
So, Weapon no longer exists on the Planet?
Weapon cannot vanish. ...It remains asleep somewhere on the 
Planet.
Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at 
some time...
The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still watching 
Jenova.
Where is Weapon?
I don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well...
Times... have changed. The Planet... is probably watching this 
situation closely.
...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today.
What are you doing, Profes...... I mean, honey?
Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not 
working right...
What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't 
mentioned?
No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.
And when she's sleeping, her face ...looks like an angel.
First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video 
later!
I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aerith. 
That's that!
You are SO selfish! But Aerith is a good name!
Hee hee... it's a good name, considering it came out of that 
forgetful head of yours!
Right!? Oh, the video tape......
Video again? You just got through taping!
.........Please don't say it that way.
It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine!
Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?
If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be 
strong...
Aerith is different from the other children. I wonder what 
dangers await her...?
Never say that! I will protect you and Aerith no matter what!!
You and Aerith are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!
I feel so much better now, darling.
If I hadn't met you, I......
Who could that--! I was just about to...
Damn!!
How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!
I'll send them away.
Yes, at once!!
Who the devil?
It, it's them!!
Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or
should I say, Cetra!
Long time no see, Professor Gast!
Hojo... How did you know?
Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.
Two years I waited.... That's how much I wanted this new 
sample..... Ha, ha, ha.
...New sample? You don't mean Aerith!?
Hmm, Aerith? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha.
That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.
Hojo, please leave.
Please, Aerith has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, 
right?
Ifalna!
I'll need all of you for my experiment.
You understand, don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the 
future of the Planet!
Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!
Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my 
precious sample.
Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!
Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha......
Wh... what are you doing, Professor!?
Ifalna! Take Aerith and run!!
Eyaaaaah... Darling......!!
Oh, and uh... don't forget the child!
Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon!?
Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure! Thank you, Professor... 
Ha, ha, ha.
No, don't! It's a steep downgrade past here!
It's dangerous, please don't go!
I'm still going
Damn, I was just being nice...
What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!
No, no. I just did what came natural.
There they are, hurry!
Yes ma'am!
Cloud... huff... wheeze.
I won't let you go any further!
What's down there?
It's a SE-CR-ET.
It really doesn't matter! But you really got guts doin' my boss 
in like that!
You mean Boss... Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it.
No! Don't think you can fool me, liar!
I'm not lying... it was Sephiroth.
Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!
Oh, man...
Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to 
feel some pain!
Just you... and me!!
No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch.
What? Yeah......
Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it...
There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.
Put them in some house in the village.
Ele... Elena!?
What the...? They sure were weak for Shinras.
Sorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was 
going to be trouble.
Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me 
to teach you to ride one?
All right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt.
I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a 
while...
Hey, I'll give you my snowboard.
Tell me when you get good at it.
Ugh...
I guess we're still in one piece.
Everyone all right?
Yeah, somehow.
I can't be doin' this! Damn!
So where did we land?
Looks like we've jumped pretty far...
Oh yeah, we got the map, right? Let's look at the map by 
pressing the Square button.
It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer.
You awake?
You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all
right.
My name is Holzoff. I've been living here 20 years now.
If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my 
story.
Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.
You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?
There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here 
a long time ago.
That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed 
this cliff.
30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on 
the other side.
But, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to 
be low but...
On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air 
lowers your body temperature.
Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope...
...and I didn't even notice...
Ever since then, I've settled here... continuing to challenge 
the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers.
If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll 
need to take.
First, check your route... It's hard to find because of all the 
snow.
Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm youselves 
up.
Understand?
You must've used a lot of energy getting up here... Better get 
some rest before you head out.
You know, I've been thinkin'...?
Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature 
is.
But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to... 
you know...
I tell you one thing though. If I did have to live here I'd 
change things around 'n' make it better.
I guess the total opposite of this would be...... Midgar.
When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad...
Uuuuurrrrrgh!!
What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?
We'll secure the route. You come up later.
Ugh....... Errgaahh!!
An old crater...
Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here......
Leaving a scar on the planet.
Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered up all that energy to try
an' heal itself.
Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor.
Next time the wound won't be so small.
...b, back... to... Seph... ...i...roth...
The time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?
I, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth.
Let's go!
That's......!!!
So, I finally found you.
Kyaa haa hah.
Kyaa haa hah.
haa hah
haa.............hah
This is incredible......
This is the Promised Land the President has been searching 
for!!
But, I'll be the one who gets it.
Sorry, old man.
Heh heh heh......
That land is no one's.
It's where the Reunion will take place...... They will all 
gather here......
I wonder if I will see...... Sephiroth?
We need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!
This is the end for all of you.
Sephiroth!!!
This is the end!
You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness.
He disappeared!?
He might still be nearby......
Our...?
Hey, hey, ! What's goin' on?
Master...!?
Jenova's cells...
...hmm. So that's what this is all about.
The Jenova Reunion...
Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we 
were after?
I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about 
is beating Sephiroth.
But Sephiroth is...
He's here. the real Sephiroth is just beyond here.
It's both incredibly wicked and cruel...
But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within 
this planet's wound.
...The Black Materia is back in our hands.
Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the 
end of it.
We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't 
you give it to someone else to hold on to?
You want me to take the Black Materia? ......all right, I 
understand.
Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you.
Let's find Sephiroth!!
We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch.
What is this? What happened?
Calm down, Tifa.
Sephiroth is near. Anything could
happen.
Nibelheim...
What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?
This is an illusion Sephiroth made up.
He's trying to confuse us.
It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's 
nothing to be afraid of.
Come on, let's keep going.
Yeah, you're right...
Look!!
All right, let's go.
Cloud's not here......
Stop... Sephiroth.
This is so stupid...
Hey, Cloud. Let's get back to the real world, huh.
Cloud... It's just an illusion.
Don't worry about it...
What's.. next?
Stop it already!!
This is terrible...
...This is what actually happened five years ago.
But...
It's probably not me that's going to come out of the Shinra 
mansion.
He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion.
See... didn't I tell you?
Hey! It's you! You're still sane,
right?
Then come over here and help me!
I don't want to... watch this. Cloud... don't watch.
I'll check this house. You check that one over there.
...What's wrong, Tifa? I told you before, right?
As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need 
to be scared.
He... hey you! You alright!?
Damn! This was all made up.
Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!
That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago.
That's it, isn't it?
I see you finally understand.
What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, 
right?
But... even making me see those things won't affect me.
I remember it all. The heat of the fire... the pain in my 
body... and in my heart!
Oh, is that so?
You are just a puppet... you have no heart... and cannot feel 
any pain...
How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?
What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is 
the illusion.
...Do you understand?
I don't want to understand.
But, I want to ask you one thing. Why... why are you doing 
this?
Ha, ha, ha......
I want to take you back to your real self.
The one who gave me the Black Materia that day...
Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so
useful?
Hojo would die if he knew.
Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?
Five years ago you were...
...constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim 
was burnt.
A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the 
power of Mako.
An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. ...That 
is your reality.
Cloud... Don't listen to him...
Close your ears! Close your eyes!
What's wrong, Tifa? I'm not affected by it.
...I wasn't paying attention to him.
All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie.
Don't we have our memories together?
Being kids together, starlit nights...
Ha, ha, ha... Tifa...
Why are you so worried and scared by those words?
Hmm... Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?
Ha, ha, ha... You look like you're not feeling well.
...Tifa? Is Sephiroth right?
Cloud...
Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right.
No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that 
Sephiroth says.
It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am.
There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories.
But, Tifa.......
But you said, 'Long time no see, Cloud' right?
Those words will always support me.
I am the one you grew up with. I'm Cloud of Nibelheim.
No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth.
That's why you shouldn't be so scared.
No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your attitude that 
counts...
No, that's not true, Cloud......
What's not? Aren't I  the same Cloud you grew up with?
That's not what I meant... I don't know how to say it...
Cloud, I need some time... Just give me a little time...
Cloud... Don't blame Tifa.
The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the 
power of Jenova.
Inside of you, Jenova has merged with Tifa's memories, creating 
you.
Out of Tifa's memory...
A boy named Cloud might've just been a part of them.
Cloud...
Please... don't think right now.
Ha, ha, ha...... Think, Cloud!
...Cloud? Ha, ha, ha...... Oh, excuse me. You never had a name.
Shut up... Sephiroth.
You still don't understand? Then...
Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for 
Mt. Nibel?
...Tifa, you remember, right?
But there is no way he would know.
Now... what happened to that picture?
.......is this it?
...Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good.
Cloud... don't...
I... should be in the picture.
Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory 
world Sephiroth made up.
...Just as I thought.
This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory.
...Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the 
reactor. I was sixteen.
The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do...? Oh yeah...
Yeah, I went to Tifa's room. There, I...
I played the piano!
I looked in the drawers!
I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was 
excited about it.
Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in 
SOLDIER.
...SOLDIER, First Class?
...SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER?
How did I join SOLDIER?
Why... why can't I remember?
I'm... I'm...
That's right...
...I didn't have to worry about it, because I was...
......Cloud?
Let's go, Tifa. I'm... I'm all right.
Wow!! That's amazing!
It's all Materia!!
The ouside is rich with Mako energy, The inside is a treasure 
trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land.
There is no such thing as the Promised Land. It's a legend... an 
old wives tale... ...it's utterly ridiculous.
Everything as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?
It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate 
scientist.
What's happening?
It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's 
moving!
Weapon...
Then it really does exist... I didn't believe in it.
What does this mean?
...Weapon. Monsters created by the Planet.
It appears when the Planet is in danger, reducing everything to 
nothingness.
That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report.
I never saw that report... Where is it?
Here, right here.
You keep a lot of things to yourself.
I wonder how Cloud and the others are...
It's hard to believe... such a small piece of materia is able to 
destroy the Planet...
What the!?
Is everyone all right?
What's going on?
Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!
Red XIII, you're here! I'm so glad!!
Tifa!!
Something is strange... Why was it dark all of a sudden and 
where is everybody?
Everyone's waiting! Cloud's in trouble!
Please come. Help us!
Over there!
R, right!
I'm not sure I understand... but I'll go if you want me to.
......hee hee hee... And remember...
...the Black Materia!
Mr. President... I've got a bad feeling about this place...
Hmm... perhaps we should return to the ship now.
We need to prepare for the inspection anyway.
Hey!!! Where did you come from?
...don't know...
This place is going to get rough.
Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still 
can!!
Leave things to you? Hmph... I don't know what you mean.
This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins 
and ends.
Cloud!
I'm here to help you, Cloud!
Thanks... Red XIII. Where's the Black Materia?
Cloud!
It's safe. I'm holding onto it.
I'll take it from here. Give me the... Black Materia.
You can't hear my voice?
Are you all right, Cloud?
Then... here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this 
thing.
No, don't! Please... stop, Cloud!
Thanks. ......leave the rest to me.
Everyone, thanks for everything. And... I'm sorry.
...Sorry.
...Sorry.
Especially you, Tifa. I'm really sorry.
You've been good to me...... I don't know what to say...
I never lived up to being 'Cloud'.
Tifa... Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'Cloud'.
Ha, ha, ha... this is perfect!!!
It means that my experiment was a complete success!
What number were you? Huh? Where is your tattoo?
Professor Hojo... I don't have a number.
You didn't give me one because I was a failed experiment.
What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
Professor... please give me a number. Please, Professor...
Shut up, miserable failure...
Who... was that?
...He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth 
died five years ago.
Jenova cells amd Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been 
combined with science and nature to bring him to life.
...I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion 
Theory has now been proven.
You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will 
eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.
I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have 
passed, and now the Clones have begun to return.
I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where 
Jenova is stored.
But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself 
began to move away from the Shinra Building.
But being a genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it 
was all Sephiroth's doing.
Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the 
Lifestream; he wants to maniplate the Clones himself.
Yes, that was how it got started.
I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to 
figure it out.
I couldn't figure it out, either.
The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their 
final destinations.
I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth.
I was being summoned by Sephiroth.
All the anger and hatred I bore him made it impossible for me to 
ever forget him. That and what he gave me.
Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I have brought you the Black 
Materia.
Show yourself to me. Where are you?
Sephiroth... So we finally meet again.
Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!
This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's will!
They won't be diffused into the Lifestream,
but gathered here! Mwa, haa, ha,.....
What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, 
don't you?
Cloud has the Black Materia!
Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is 
going to die!
Whatever I say now is too little... too late... We must 
evacuate.
I want you all to come with me. There is still much more I want 
to hear.
Cloud, NO! Stop! Please!
Cloud-----!!
Cloud...
Cloud...
......I didn't know what else to do. I was always like that...
What's the matter?
ohhh...
......poor kid.
Ooouugh......
Are you all right?
oo... uh... agh
Uh... uh... Tifa...?
Tifa...?
Tifa!
...................?
Oh, Cloud!
That's right. I'm Cloud.
Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here!
Yeah, it's been a while.
What happened to you? You don't look well.
......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay.
How long has it been?
Five years.
............
What is it?
...It's really been a long time.
Actually, it's been seven years.
You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth 
incident, and now you're a mercenary...
You told me a lot about what happened after you left 
Nibelheim...
But...
...Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about 
the things you talked about.
All the things you didn't know that you should. And other things 
you shouldn't know that you did...
I wanted to make sure...
But then I heard... you were going far away...
And I didn't want that...
I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.
And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to 
be with you, watch you.
Ding...
Huh?
The glare...
You'll be better soon. You've been asleep a long time.
I'm hungry...
Hey, why don't you ask?
About him.
...Because I'm scared.
Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.
Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry...
None of them know if he's all right or not.
He's still... alive, right?
How long... was I asleep?
Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days.
What about Sephiroth?
You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the 
Northern Cave?
Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of 
light.
Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by 
the barrier.
We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he 
wakes up.
And on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a
rampage.
...Weapon?
Remember that huge monster that was made with Sephiroth, at the 
bottom of the crater?
Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from 
the past.
Weapon... is protecting Sephiroth?
Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up.
Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got 
guts.
We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no 
time...
Time...
...Hey! How about Meteor?
Do we have to give up?
...Dunno.
I thought Cloud would show up to save you all...
Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too.
What are you going to do to Cloud?
Sephiroth's alter ego...
Meteor has been summoned... Essentially, it's all but over now.
So, there's no need for you now.
No, maybe there is an important task for you...
President! Preparations for the public execution are complete.
Execution!?
What're ya gonna get by executin' us?
You are to be executed for causing this situation.
People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is 
punished.
I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass!
Well, enjoy your last moments
together.
I'll tie your arms now.
Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness 
into the world!
The hell are these people?
We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national
television.
Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?
With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately 
need to rally public support... it's better that we punish somebody, 
anybody.
You make me sick...
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!
We'll start with this girl.
If you've gotta do it... do me first!
Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats 
up tearful goodbyes!
What are you doing!?
This is my special gas chamber.
Take your time, and enjoy a slow, painful
death.
Stuck up ^%$#&!!
Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha!
Emergency! Emergency!
Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take 
your positions!
Oh no! It's Weapon!
Run!
Hey, hey, all of you!
Damn! Why now?
How does it feel now, Scarlet?
Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right 
now......
Nngaaaaaahhhh!
Huh!? Sleeping gas?
Weirdo!!
I'm here to help!
Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?
Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides... I 
hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa.
I'll keep watch at the entrance.
It won't open!
It's Weapon.
There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?
I believe so. Your orders?
No need to ask.
We'll give it a shot from our big cannon.
Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!
Preparations complete!
The cannon...
Fire----!!!
Did we get 'em?
Seems so...
Weapon approaching!
Speed, 50 knots!
It's heading right toward us!
It can't be! We hit it dead on!
How about the cannon?
It'll take time to reload.
Then use regular firepower in the mean time!
Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it 
land!
Speed: 70 knots!
Weapon closing in!
Not good! It's attacking!
Gas!!
Barret, help!!
Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!
Come on! I can't hold on forever!
Shi-!
The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!
Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this 
room first.
Tifa! I'll help you, I promise!
No! They locked this too!
Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!!
Goddammit......!!
OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!
Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?
Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance.
Damn, man!
Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!
Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?
You damn cat......! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all 
be comin' soon!
Yo, better watch my back till the end... partner!
Which button stops the gas...?
Open it---......
What d'you do? Hey! Open it!
First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling 
me to come out? Make up your mind!
Our little game of hide and seek
ends here.
The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by 
falling from here and crashing into the water below might be pretty 
exciting.
Stuck up to the end!
Quit slapping me! You old wench!
God! I can't stand it!
Take her away.
Now it's time to pay up. I'll really drop you if you don't 
settle down!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Run...
Run to the end of the Cannon!!
You okay?
My cheeks hurt a bit.
Forget about that, what's this all about?
Well, I'll catch the details later.
In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours.
Dammit! Why didn't you tell me you could fly an airship?
I thought...... Tifa was gone for good.
Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.
Come on! Everyone is waiting!
Everyone? Everyone's here?
Welcome to my airship- the Highwind!
What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!
Cid......
Yeah......
Not enough crew.
Well, it takes all kinds.
Tifa, I'll give you information Shinra.
Ask me if there's anything you don't understand.
Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things 
up!
Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us.
Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?
Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?
Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage......
At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......
No idea at all......
Get a hold of yourself Tifa! C'mon, let's think about this!
No way we can get offa this train we're on!
......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine.
Cloud would......
Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.
He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.'
Tifa! When'd you become such a wimp!
I'm sorry Barret.
I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed.
And Tifa...... the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was 
because......
......I know.
That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him 
again.
I want you to know that I didn't dislike him.
Gotta admit he was a strange dude.
Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn 
fool thing.
And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.
Everything about him from his movements to his speech were 
kinda odd.
Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.
Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again 
someday, so cheer up, sis.
......I'll be able to see him someday.
If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in 
no time.
......Maybe
Cloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground 
cracked and swallowed him up......
Buried in the depths of the underground......
Deep within the earth... are you talking about the Lifestream?
The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks 
in the ocean floor.
I heard that such a place exists.
Maybe, just maybe Cloud's......
Waaaah! Captain Cid!
Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the 
ship.
Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.
Oh, and Tifa......
No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.
Go to your room and get ready for our operation.
What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?......
We did fine without him in the beginning......
Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd 
she go to?
I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so go get 
them in order.
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!
So things have come to this... When you want to take off, just 
tell the pilot on the bridge.
......Well......... Um, what should I talk about?
Wanna hear why we rebelled?
Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under 
Heidegger.
Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately 
take it out on the crew.
We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us.
I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, 
and there's no way I was going to quit over him.
Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we 
were heading towards the North Cave.
Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.
And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot!
And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, 
y'know, nostalgic......
He even talked to us.
I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as 
warmhearted as we'd always heard.
Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot 
easier.
And now here we are off to save the Planet. It's true. He really 
overwhelmed me.
And that's why we decided to help.
After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 
'Fire! Fire!'
In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the 
Shinra.
That's how it happened. ......Just a minor mutiny against our 
leaders.
But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......
We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we 
finally could.
So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you 
again.
I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.
I'm bored...... I'd like to ride a Chocobo.
Listen...... you gotta ride in on a Chocobo once you've raised 
yourself
Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, I'll take care 
of it for you.
I'll take care of it for you.
What? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about 
that.
If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo 
ranch near Midgar. You should ask them.
Whew......
Tifa, thank you for a job well done!
Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet 
little Hot Springs town.
Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our 
lives.
I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here 
it's still nice and quiet.
But anyhow, that overgrown moon is going to fall down on us 
isn't it?
This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies 
before they're all gone!
Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it!
Welcome! We always welcome cash! What can I help you with 
today?
Thank you! Come again!
Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're 
things on the outside?
Between the earthquakes and Meteor...... it just might be the 
end of the world like everyone's been saying'...
Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is......
You again! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?
Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!
I've got money to burn! I've been saving like mad just for a 
time like this!
C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you, move!
Welcome, this store! Very rest and recreation shop. Where you 
go?
Oh no, other customer take up everything. Not leave anything 
for you...
...gah, hah, hah... dassa joke! So where you go?
Thank very much! You come 'gain.
Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!!
We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you 
won't find anywhere else.
But it's first come first served, so get yours now!
Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside.
Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!
I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town 
like this. What's up with him......? ...sigh......
Oh...... there's not much time left!! You never know when that 
moon is gonna come crashing down!!
When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and 
material things!
If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!
Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What 
can I get you today?
Thank you very much! Please come again.
Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your 
turn. Even the world's gotta end sometime.
Everybody leaves at one time or another. And everyone gets left 
also. That's just fate...
It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So 
that's why I'm prayin' like this for all of you.
You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall outta the 
sky? Is that for real?
I still don't believe it! How could this be happen?
Ancient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about 
that! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!
There's tons of stuff I still gotta do! This's just ths 
beginning.
And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're 
a waste!!
Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the 
accessory store part-time.
Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, 
how about one?
Thank you. Stop by again.
Huh......? What could that be?
There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key... 
it's hard to get out.
Well, I'll just let it go for now......
What's the matter? Are you all alone?
You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? 
Silly thing...
......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here 
on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing...
It was really sad...... but weird. He was holding this really 
long sword.
I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing 
thing was those weird blue eyes.....
Wha!?
Wh...... wait a minute!! What did you just say!?
Excuse me! That young person you were just talking about......
Yeah... a villager found him a little ways down the coast... 
It was about a week ago I think.
Yeah, poor kid... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far 
away...
Cloud!! It must be!! It's Cloud!!
Heh, good job, Tifa.
You sure!?
So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now......?
Yeah... up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic......
He's alive...!
Cloud...... Cloud's alive!!
Cloud!!
Uh....? Yo, Tifa!
Cloud!?
Here now. The way you're
running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something.
I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care 
of here......
A friend...?
Oh yeah......! That young fellow!?
Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his 
condition is...
Here?
Over here.
Cloud...!?
Oh... Cloud!! I'm so glad you're safe!?
......!?
Cloud......?
Uh...... aaa......?
Wh...... what's wrong...... Cloud......?
A...... Gurk......?
Cloud! What happened to you.....!?
Mako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case......
It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako 
energy for a protracted period of time.
He probably has no idea who or where he is now......
Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles 
away from us.
Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone......
Doctor......!!
Damn...... that's evil.
That's bad......
Cloud......
Ahem! Let us excuse ourselves.
Listen, would you all mind......... waiting outside?
.........
Why......? What do you want me to do?
Please, Cloud...... Talk to me......
Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, 
please......
I came this far believing in the memories we have together...
This isn't happening......! This is too cruel......
Oh, Cloud......! I.........
So what about him? You know...... Cloud?
I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a 
case this bad...
An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his 
brain all at once......
No normal human could have survived it...... It's a miracle he 
did!
No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed 
up here.........
But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.
Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him?
......hope......
Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back?
What did he do for this world? What can he do for us from here 
on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......
Is something wrong?
No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc.
.........
You okay?
Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried.
And I have something I want to tell you all......
I don't care about anything else, only Cloud......
I...... want to be by his side......
Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa.
Yeah, that's probably best......
For Cloud...... an' for you......
I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......
Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime.
You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud.
Right......
Oh, and uh, Tifa... I don't like askin' this but......
Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?
Huh!? Well... that is......
No, I'm sure of it!
Yeah......? Okay then...... Sorry for askin' that.
Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind.
What're we gonna do now? What can WE do?
Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?
An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better.
Oh, I've got some news.
Yeah, what!? That you a spy?
Yeah...... I've already told you I was.
Both Gya ha ha and Kya ha ha are up to something.
Wanna eavesdrop?
Now then...... We're faced with two issues.
1. Destroy Meteor. 2. Remove the barrier around North Cave and
defeat Sephiroth.
Any ideas?
Gya haah hah hah! We already solved the first problem!
Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!
The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect 
Huge Materia from each region.
Well......
Huge Materia is a high density special type of materia made 
through a special compression process in Mako reactors.
I caught a fish THIS BIG
The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal 

materia.
Ha, ha, ha! How about that!?
We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into 
Meteor.
That will cause a huge explosion!! Reducing Meteor literally to 
bits.
You're going to ram into Meteor?
Do you think we have the technology to do it?
Don't worry about that!
More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area.
We've already collected materia from Nibelheim.
All that's left is 
 and 
.
I've already dispatched troops to Corel.
Ghaa haah hah hah!
Corel!
What else can they do to Corel!?
And the Huge Materia......
You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.
When our small materia hears the larger one, something should 
happen.
I'm certain of it.
That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight......
Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!
Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him his Huge Materia. 
He's gonna be shocked.
So, what are you saying, Barret?
Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to 
return.
I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just... shut your 
face!
Every group's gotta have a leader.
An' that's me!
Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader.
I never knew that till lately.
An' that's what is......
......ZZZZ...... hmph?
Wha? What's goin' on?
You been chosen to be the new leader.
Pain in the ass. Forget it.
But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.
We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!
That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can.
Hm..... this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna 
be just a little tough?
Oh man, that went straight to my heart.
I'm a man, too!
Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!
Awright, now here's the first job.
The Operation Room's waiting for
you!
Yeah!!
Yo, Cid!
When you're ready, we're headin'
for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry.
Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, 
Captain......
Good day, Captain!
Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor......
I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was 
that......?
Cid.
Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time.
Yo, Mr. Leader! Get your pilot ass up here!
Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gatherin' up all 
the Huge Materia.
I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the 
Corel Reactor.
Hey, what's gonna happen to the world...?
I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold 
Saucer is closing...
The next train's coming in soon.
With Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference...
I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and 
start a new life.
If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that 
town across the river...
Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided.
But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
There was something glowing in that well over there.
If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the 
Gold Saucer!
You guys are...!
Guess we're safe for now...!
Ohh!
Da---mn!
Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that 
train!
NO! You damn boneheads!
Did the Shinra beat us!?
Hey, do you know who I am?
I'm Cid - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey---!
How can they even drive this?
Don't ask me... I don't know!
What!?
Don't worry! I can handle this kinda stuff!
Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...
I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?
Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 
minutes.
We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!
All right! We're gonna jump!!
What the! You... you guys!
All right-- Just hand over the Huge Materia!
Sh......
Whooooa----!
You got guts comin' after me!
I'll never forget you!
Got no time for that now!
We got it going, but what about the brakes?
I KNOW, already! Just shut up and keep quiet! If we keep this 
up, we'll crash right into North Corel!
Let's see... if we alternately use the levers to accelerate...
It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!
Hey, it's not working!
We're gaining speed!
^%#@! The other way!? Just watch, this time, I'll...
Hey... HEY HEY!
SHI-------!!
You sure are brave. I'm impressed!
You guys are really something!
Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?
The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again...
It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, 
Barret!!
Of... of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!
No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like 
coal!
To hell with Meteor! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?
We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor!
That's it!
Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fighting the 
Shinra?
I got it out of the well. Isn't it an amazing rock!!
Must've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your 
body.
I already talked to the Inn's owner, today you can rest for 
free.
Whenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in 
the face......
If you're comin' down, then hurry up do it!! 'Cause I'm gonna 
kick the $#@& outta ya!
What the? Don't get hit by the train!
You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway...
When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing 
stones!
I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to 
happen.
We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this 
battlefield.
Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.
If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?
Listen I don't want to push but, if you've got something else 
to do, why don't you finish that first?
All right then...... Take care of yourselves...
Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
Hmmn, now this is something. I never thought anyone would climb 
up here.
Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd 
better get down before you get involved.
A battlefield, we can't overlook that.
Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
Shinra again.
It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you 
climbed up here.
Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?
All right, talk on!
Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?
Huh? Something's up there?
No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of 
it, is that the Condor?
I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a 
condor.
Looks like there's a special materia up in the Mako reactor.
Then came the condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid 
of it.
Their plan is to get rid of the condor and the people on this 
mountain and to get the materia from the Mako Reactor.
Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra 
ourselves.
That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.
As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by 
fighting alongside of us...
What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?
If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do 
something if you leave it to us.
Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand,
too.
I'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed 
and the condors from being killed.
Hello. Do your best. We will, too.
You hang in there!
So shall I let you in on our strategy?
The enemy is targeting this mountain's reactor and will be 
climbing to reach it.
We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect the place.
Well, this is all we have...... this village doesn't have any 
money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.
To hire one soldier, we need 400 gil. So, if we have 20 
soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.
That is, we would like you to use your own money to hire these 
soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and give the commands.
We know that we're asking is selfish. We sent out our wives and 
kids to another village. We are resigned to our fate.
Let's get it back to square one. If the enemy penetrates this 
shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately.
I know it's a one shot deal, but I'm asking for your help.
Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?
Ready?
This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever 
before.
YES! We did it! That was wonderful! Thank you!! I doubt Shinra 
will attack now.
A, arrgghh......
Th, that light just now...... The condor...... The eggs......
What!? Would you go outside and see what it was?
Gone...
Be sure and report to my father, too.
Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks.
Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure 
you can stop in and stay any time, so be sure to drop by.
Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you......
Huh? What's this?
Damn man, it's Huge Materia.
The truth is, this is the matera inside the reactor.
What the hell did we fight for?
We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the 
condors.
When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how 
we knew what was inside the reactor.
I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked 
in and took the materia.
I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. 
I'm really sorry.
Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.
I see. If you put it that way...... we're really grateful.
So the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater 
reactor in Junon?
We gotta get there first and beat'em no matter what!
But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always 
mess with 'em.
How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a 
bit?
You mus' mean Cloud......
Yeah, I'm worried aobut Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care 
of the guy.
How about checkin' on 'em? Down to Mideel!
I'm sorry...... But your friend's condition remains 
unchanged......
You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take 
time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence.
......It's no use...... I don't understand a thing, Cloud.
What should I do......? What if you never recover for the rest 
of your life?
Eyaaah!?
......They're...... They're...... coming......!!
What did you say, Cloud!?
Uh...... aaa......?
Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?
What's this...!?
The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the 
earth!
Damn, that's......!? This is bad.....!!
Cid......!? What's wrong?
N, nothin'!! You and Cloud get inside quick!!
But I......!?
Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that 
easily.
Be careful...!
Okay, here I go! Watch this!!
Damn!! That &%$^%$
Weapon!!
Of all the times to show up......!
OK then, come on!! You
&$^%$!
You &^$#&$#! You tryin' to escape?
Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I wouldda smashed 
him......
It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well.
Damn, you gotta be kiddin'......!!
Th, this's bad......! The main stream is kickin' up!!
Somethin' way bigger that that last one is on its way!!
No good!! Get outta here......!!
But what about Tifa and Cloud!?
Goddammit!!
You don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! 
You don't know when that stream'll blow......
Whoa!!
There's no time, hurry!!
Tifa!! Cloud!! Get outta here!!
This is bad...... The tremors are getting worse.
Wait a minute, Cloud.
Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay 
here...?
Hmm...... It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open 
space.
Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud......
I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!
No! The structure can't take it!! Hurry!
Yes!
Ready Cloud? We're leaving now!!
Wh, where am I......? What's happening? I......?
Where's Cloud......!? Cloud, where are you!?
Huh...... what......? Who......?
Who is it......? I can't hear......
Wait a minute......! I don't know anything about that!
No! It's not me......! I'd never do anything like that!!
No! Stop it......!! Stay back!
Somebody...... help! Please!!
Cloud, help me!!
Eyaaaaghh......!!
............ Where am I......?
Cloud!?
What is it, Cloud? What is this......!?
Is this the inside of your dream? Or is it...... your...... 
subconsciousness......?
You're searching, aren't you, Cloud?
Searching...... for yourself......
I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you 
back!
But...... Where do we start......?
The gates of Nibelheim... Five years ago, Sephiroth passed 
through these gates......
And...... That's how it all started......
It connects...... to Nibelheim......?
That's right... It's probably best to start from there......
Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll 
be right with you......
Cloud... look.
Here's the well...
And that's Gramps' Inn, too.
The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little 
kids, right?
This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?
It's the same as my Nibelheim That's why this place is... our 
Nibelheim.
Five years ago... two men from SOLDIER came...
Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier.
Can you tell me again what happened?
So how does it feel?
Five years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first 
time.
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?
So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...
Ummm... how 'bout your parents?
So this is... the Great Sephiroth.
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. 
My father...
But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold.
What does it matter...?
All right, let's go.
I remember, I felt a foreboding about him.
No, Cloud.
I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you... 
something terrible might happen.
But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.
You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years 
ago.
I... waited. But, Cloud... never came.
The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another 
person...
All right, let's go.
You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth 
wasn't...... Cloud......?
There's nothing......... I can say......
You must find the answer yourself......
If you can't...... Then you......
Take your time, Cloud. Slowly...... little by little, okay?
That starry night at the well...... And our promise that 
night... What if the memory was just a lie?
Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly.
Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come 
back...... Slowly...... little by little......
Right... like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled 
with stars......
From the beginning... OK?
Try and remember, Cloud.
Right, I was wearing these clothes.
That's you, too. You were so small then......
...and cute.
Sephiroth once said...
Cloud made up his memories by listening to my stories....
Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it.
That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just Cloud and I. We 
talked at the well...
That's why I continued to believe that you were the real 
Cloud.
I still believe you're the Cloud from Nibelheim...
But you don't believe in yourself...
These memories aren't enough.
Cloud, what about your other memories?
No, not memories.
A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, 
right?
That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different 
thing......
But it's different from a memory locked deep within your 
heart......
That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that 
memory......
That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?
I say something and you don't remember it......
But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know 
that's our memory......
Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...
Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the 
first place?
I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......
......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.
......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.
I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to 
notice.........
Someone has to notice you...? ......who?
Who.........? ......You know who! ......You, that's who.
You......
......Me? Why!?
Tifa...... did you forget...... about those days?
Look...... I......
I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?
No...... it's all right. You were having a hard time back then.
You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you 
don't remember me back then.
'Back then'?
It's important to me...... I hate to say it but...... It's a 
very important memory......
Do you want to see it?
......a sealed up secret...... wish......
Tender memories...... no one can ever know.........
Do you want to know where this window goes to, Tifa?
Fine...... I'll go.
My room?
It was my first time there.
Was... it?
I only used to look up at it from outside.
Hey, look!
Cloud's coming!
You think he wants to come in?
Was that the first day you came into my room?
...that's right.
We lived next to each other.
But I really didn't know you that well.
I've known you since we were children and I always thought we 
were close...
Now that you mention it... I don't recall you ever being in my 
room...
Tifa always used to be with this three-some.
...That's right.
I used to think... they were all stupid.
What?
You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing.
But we were children, back then.
...I know. I'm the one that was stupid.
I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed 
into the group.
Then later... I began to think I was different...
That I was different from those immature kids.
That then... maybe...
Just maybe, they would invite me in.
I thought that might happen, so I hung around...
I was so prejudiced. And... weak.
That night I called Tifa out to the well...
I thought to myself Tifa would never come, that she hated me.
Yeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised.
But...
It's true that we weren't THAT close, but...
After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.
I used to wonder how Cloud was doing.
I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?
I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an 
article about you.
Thanks, Tifa.
Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy.
OK!
Huh?
What happened on this day? Was it a special day?
This was the day...
Tifa's mother...
The day Mom died...
I want... to see... mom...
...I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?
Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there.
No one crosses that mountain alive...
How 'bout those that died?
Did mama pass through the mountains?
I'm going!
I don't remember what path I walked.
Tifa missed her step. I ran to her... but didn't make it in 
time.
Both of us fell off the cliff.
Back then, I only scarred my knees, but......
Cloud! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this!
What the hell's the matter with you!?
What if she dies!?
Tifa was in a coma for seven days.
We all thought she wouldn't make it.
If only I could've saved her...
I was so angry... Angry at myself for my weakness.
Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me...
I got out of control... I'd get into fights not even caring who 
it was.
That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth.
If I got strong like Sephiroth, then everyone might...
If I could just get stronger...... Then even Tifa would have to 
notice me......
So that was it......
Sorry, Cloud.
If I had only remembered more clearly what had happened, I could 
have done something sooner......
It's not your fault, Tifa.
But, I remember back when we were eight!
That's it! Now I know!
You weren't created five years ago.
My childhood memories weren't all made up!
Hang in there Cloud! Just a little longer! You've almost found 
the real you!
Let's go back to Nibelheim again......!
The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the 
palm of our hands.
Cloud, wait.
Where are you going?
......The reactor......?
To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!
Hey! It's Cloud!
Za......ck...... Zac......k. Zack...
You remembered!!
That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!
Then, where were you, Cloud?
Cloud... Did you... see it all?
I saw...... everything......
Mom... Tifa... my town... give it back...
Aaarrrgh...... who... who are you?
I had so much respect for you... I admired you...
Cloud!?
That's what happened...
You were there.
You were watching me.
Yeah, I remember.
Hmm... so it was you.
Hey, Cloud. If you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask 
off?
Yeah...
Yeah... this is... me.
I... never made it as a member of SOLDIER.
I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, 
but...
I was so embarrassed...... I didn't want to see anybody.
How does it feel?
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, 
right?
I'm...
...You came. ...You kept your promise.
So you really did come when I was in trouble!
Sorry... I didn't get there... fast enough...
It's all right... Cloud.
Just like you.
Cloud... Kill Sephiroth...
Sephiroth!
Don't... push... your luck...
...It can't be!
Cloud......
Then... this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again......
............!?
Cloud!!
Uh...... Ah, Uh......!
Uh...... Tifa......
Oh, Cloud......! It's really you, isn't it?
Yeah...... Tifa...... We finally...... meet again......
You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!
Krgh......!
Cloud!? Are you all right!?
V, voice...... Their......
I see. We're... in the Lifestream aren't we?
Everyone's waiting.
Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone......
Yeah, I guess so... Come on, Tifa. Let's go home......
Yo! You awright!? Tifa!?
u... uhh......?
Barret... You came back, I......
Cloud... Where is he?
Don't worry about him. He's a
tough one.
Barret...... I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real 
Cloud.
I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his 
own...
Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him.
But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.
People have so many things pent up inside of themselves...
And they can forget so many things......
Strange...... isn't it............
Yo, Tifa! Snap outta it!!
Tifa......!?
Everyone...... I'm sorry. I don't know what to say......
Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing.
I never was in SOLDIER.
I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, 
about being in SOLDIER.
I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to 
SOLDIER......
I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from 
my friend Zack...
And I greated an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen 
in my life.....
And I continued to play the charade as if it were true.
Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say.
I'm physically built like someone on SOLDIER.
Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult.
It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of 
SOLDIER.
You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.
Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......
For better or for worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER.
It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.
But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing.
The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my 
own weaknesses are what created me.
Everyone knew that. I'm...... Cloud.
......the master of my own illusionary world.
But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more......
I'm going to live my life without pretending.
You're sure messed up, Cloud!
That means there ain't no difference from before!
By the way, Cloud. What are you going to do now?
Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?
......I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us.
That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this 
thing.
Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet!?
It's like you always told me, Barret.
Oh, uh, you mean that!
What? I don't understand!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
The train we on don't make no stops!
Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story!
I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you 
feel, Cloud!
No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!
Listen, Cloud.
We're right in the middle of the mission for the Master Materia, 
right?
I know this's kinda outta the blue, but there's a underwater 
reactor at Junon.
As fas as I can see, that's the only one left.
That's that. Let's go!
C'mon, Cloud! Don't #&$* around!
We're goin' to Junon, boyeee!!
This's kinda on the spur of the moment, but shouldn't we oughta 
get to Junon!?
I'm glad you're back with us!
Let's do our best, Cloud!
I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one.
I always forget who has what materia.
They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world 
and bringing it to Junon.
Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.
I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I 
think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.
Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?
Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be 
destroyed.
I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe 
underwater.
The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.
You should be able to get to the reactor through it.
Who are you---?
Cloud!!
Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the 
Lifestream?
Yeah, that's right.
You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me 
one day.
If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil!
Hurry up and get in!
You're such a cheapskate.
The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea 
Reactor!
When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.
Get out of here before you get in the way!
What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get 
in the way either!
After they get in, they'll take it to the airport and will 
transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!
They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the 
Junon Underwater Reactor.
Come on in!
Welcome!!
I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon 
really existed.
They're not going to get me down! Not me!!
Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me!
Hey!! Stay out of the way!
I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore.
I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!
Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!?
All right! You can enter!!
This is a Respectable Inn... guests only!
You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.
Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off 
some stress.
Ok. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?
Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge... I mean, 
review!
I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon.
Oh, of course, I was here, studying.
And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach.
Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here 
soused as usual.
I'd like to close down the shop, but we got the regulars to 
think about... I don't know what to do......
I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing
something?
All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!
Attention! Charge--!!
He... hey--!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!
How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?
All right, you're on!!
But... What if both of us...
Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!
...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men!)
OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!
Yawn... I'm sleepy!!
For Junon!!
You, you're Cloud!!
You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!
So you WERE after the Huge Materia!
!? The Huge Materia!
They're gonna take it on that submarine!
That's what you think! ^%$@#&#!
Did we make it!?
What are you doing? Help load.
Cloud!?
You know I don't work for cheap!
Looks like we barely made it.
Either give it to us or else.
...which is it gonna be?
Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.
My priority is the Huge Materia!
Damn! The submarine!
We have to go after it!
Hold on to your horses! Let's get it from them!!
Y, you!
You're not taking over this ship!
You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!
Um... sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off...
NO, NO!! This is terrible!
We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!
There's still so much more I've got to do!
I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!
All right!! Then make this your first victory!!
Go on, show 'em!!
Yes, sir!!
Remember you last training. Begin!!
Yes, sir!!
I'm back! An' now I got no regrets!!
ATT---ACK!!
Hmmmm...
Someone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.
The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine...
What are we going to do... We stole a submarine but can't pilot 
it.
Hunka junk... just gotta do this!
SEE! Now you take over!
Hey, you're right. I DO feel a little better driving.
No sweat. Just leave everything to me.
You can do it, Cloud!
I'll be watchin' from here!
Well, now what?
Submarine Operation Manual - Beginner's Edition
Everything seems set...
This switch…?
Main screen: ON
Phew--! We did it!!
The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's 
continue the search...
All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?
...All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read...?
Hmm...? ...Must be from Shinra.
...Report, No. 2...
No. 2...
...I saw that written at the dock! They must mean this sub.
All right, I'll do it.
This is Shinra No. 2... Everything's normal.
...Roger...
...Your next mission is...
...Return to Junon Dock...
...We will transport the Huge Materia from the airport...
...Those without other assignments will report for guard duty...
That is all. Over and out...
Junon Airport... We should make it if we hurry.
Forget about the Huge Materia for now.
We're climbing!
The airport? No sweat!
Oh no! The Huge Materia...
Can't we go after it?
Where's that thing headed?
Rocket Town, of course.
The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? 
But why now...?
What's young President Rufus doing by getting all those 
mechanics together?
Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come 
out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?
Would you like something to drink?
Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore 
the rocket...
If he continues on like that, he's gonna collapse some day. 
Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack.
There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket...
Is my rocket... all right?
Mmmmm, a SPECTACLE.
Is something about to happen? Oh, I'm getting excited.
Those terrorists are here!
Don't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!
Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere! Uh un, nowhere!
Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my 
rocket!?
I'm outta here, Cloud! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right 
out of my rocket!
...you again?
...We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way.
.......they got us.
You... you! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been 
here!!
Back there
Too bad. Those guys are over there.
Oh man... the Turks, being done in like that... But, I won't let 
you through!
Hey! What the hell're you guys doin'!?
Hey! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you came back!
Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket!
Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?
We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor.
Our rocket's gonna save the planet!
Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL!!
Wait a minute!
Shut up!! Just shut the hell up!
How's the rocket?
It's pretty much OK.
But...
We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most 
important device is broken.
Broken? How's the repair goin'?
Shera's doin' it...
Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 
100 years!
I'm gonna take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!
Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone!
All right, Captain. Good luck.
Hey, Cid! What're you doing!?
There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the 
Materia.
We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from 
Sephiroth.
There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You 
understand that, right?
Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I 
also understand what you're thinking.
But listen.
I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.
No. I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the 
power of science.
Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to 
fly now!
And finally, we're about to go into outer space.
Science is a 
 created and developed by humans. And 
science just might be what saves this planet.
I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, 
there's nothing greater!
Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do!
I don't want to regret not having done something later.
But, Cid......
Shut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!
Alright, time to get back to work! Anyone who ain't involved, 
get the hell outta here!
What the hell......? What the hell happened?
Hey-hey!
Palmer! What the hell did'ya do!?
They said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I 
laun---ched it!
Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!
DAMN! Won't even budge! It's completely locked up!
Hey-hey-hey! Almost lift off!
What the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without 
it!
Hey!!!! Hey-hey!!! Blast------off!
I finally made it... outer space...
Let's see, how's the course set...?
Yup, it's headed for a collision course with Meteor.
Can't we do something? If it goes on, we're......
That Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. 
We might not be able to change the course.
...this is the end?
Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you 
give up that easily?
I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.
Just watch.
I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like 
this.
I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right 
before we crash into Meteor.
Hey, what about the Huge Materia?
......
If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!
The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder.
...You sure?
I dunno...
I know what I said a minute ago.
But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer 
space.
So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?
I finally found the Huge Materia...
It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the 
passcode from this control panel.
Hey, Cloud, you know how to use it, right?
Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those Circle, 
X, Triangle, Square buttons.
If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get 
the Huge Materia!
So, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in?
I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly.
Seems like you missed the code!
If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection 
System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!
Alright, Cloud!! It's unlocked!
Yup, my great advice saved the day.
Grrrgh!
Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris......
Cid!!
...I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it...
Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the 
rocket's gonna crash into Meteor!
...I can't go without my friends.
You ^%#@&%......! No time to worry 'bout other people!
I'm gonna do whatever I can.
You're stupid. You're really $#&^%$* stupid.
Tank Number 8 blew up...... So Tank Number 8... really was 
malfunctioning......
Shera... You were right.
But, ......this is the end for me.
Don't say that, Cid.
Huh!? Shera!?
I tagged along. I'm coming to help you.
You stupid &$#&%*%&%#!!
......Sorry.
The Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry.
Hurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod.
Hey, Shera! Does this Pod really fly?
It'll be OK. I've been checking it till now.
......Then I'm relieved.
......Thanks.
So this is... outer space...
Man... it's the real thing... I'm really here in outer space...
So long, Shinra No. 26...
Rufus and the others plan was a failure...
What a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work.
We been botherin' them as much as we can...
But there ain't no other way... Wonder if we've been wrong all 
this time?
Makes you worry, doesn't it?
Don't worry! Think!
Hey! The girl's right.
You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start 
fallin' apart and get worse and worse.
You're pretty damn optimistic! You up to somethin'?
Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that.
All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet.
I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that 
escape pod.
I've been thinking too. About the universe... planet... ocean.
How wide and big... No matter where I go and what I do it won't 
change a thing.
Maybe you're right.
But I came up with something different.
I always thought this planet was so huge.
But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.
We're just floatin' in the dark. ......kind of makes you feel 
powerless.
On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a 
sickness.
That's why I say this planet's still a kid.
A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge 
universe.
Someone's gotta protect it.
Ya follow me? That someone is us.
Cid... that's beautiful.
Yo! Cid! You even got to me!
So, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?
..................I'm still thinkin' about that.
Huh!?
Did you...... hear something?
The planet's scream...... or Meteor...? Is it this planet?
Hey, how do we know that this is really the planet's scream?
Did you forget?
Bugenhagen told us.
Bugenhagen...
Let's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!
I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful!
This's just between you 'n' me but...
That there Bugenhagen feller, used to be a pretty handy Shinra 
worker.
Yep, he ain't never bought no weapons or Mako though......
That Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude.
I though he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them 
machines.
Did Bugenhagen...... tell you anything?
Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me 
knowin' it?
All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me.
Hurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather!
Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star...
The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside.
I'd rather not see it either...
Ho Ho Hoooo. If you are ever in need of my wisdom, you are 
always welcome here.
Yeah, that's why we came.
What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each 
have to take a good long look at ourselves.
There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts.
Something buried, or something forgotten.
Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are 
all looking for...
That's easy enough to say... But, I can't remember a thing.
It must be there. Look harder!
...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come.
Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?
Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing.
I remember Aerith a lot.
No... not that. You haven't remembered. You haven't forgotten. 
That's not it...
How would you say it... Aerith was right there all along. Right 
by our side.
She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aerith did... The 
words she left behind...
That reminds me... I was the same.
As was I.
Me too...
She said that she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's 
Meteor.
But Aerith is gone.
Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aerith tried to 
accomplish?
We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.
What, did that girl go off to that place?
That's it!!
What's it?
We don't know about it.
What did Aerith know?
Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?
I see... She returned there once again, correct?
Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there.
You're going too?
What's so surprising about that...?
Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside 
world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages.
It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!
Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go.
Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you.
We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate 
stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place...
Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our 
way?
I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You 
just pull this here...
Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...?
This is really rare Materia, indeed.
Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness 
enclosed in it.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave.
Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever 
want to see Materia, come here anytime.
Hm, hmm, hmm!......
Smells like machinery.
I love this smell.
Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......
Hm? Is the deck up there?
Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time.
I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind.
I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in 
the smell of machinery...
Well, bye for now.
I went an' told Aerith's Mom about her death.
Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little 
Marlene...
And Aerith... she's dead.
Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the 
planet, huh?
But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again...
I wonder what Aerith felt... when she was on that altar...?
I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet...
Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.
I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she 
planned on coming back all along.
She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.
She talked about the future more that any of us...
Aerith...?
I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......
Aerith used to pat me on the nose sometimes.
I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also 
liked the attention.
I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met.
This is...
Yes...... exactly...
Are you getting something?
...Give me a moment.
The knowledge of the Ancients swirling around here is telling me 
one thing.
The planet's in a crisis...
A crisis beyond human power or endless time.
It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'.
Holy?
Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against 
Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor.
If a soul seeking Holy reaches the planet, it will appear.
Ho Ho Hoooo.
Meteor, Weapon, everything will disappear.
Perhaps, even ourselves.
Even us!?
It is up to the planet to decide.
What is best for the planet. What is bad for the planet.
All that is bad will disappear. That is all.
Ho Ho Hooo.
I wonder which we humans are?
Search for Holy... How do we do it?
Speak to the planet.
Get the White Materia... This will bond the Planet to humans.
Then speak to the planet.
If our wish reaches the planet, the White Materia will begin to 
glow a pale green.
...This is the end.
Aerith had the White Materia...
But when Aerith died, it fell from the altar...
That's why...... this is the end.
Ho Ho Hooo!
Ho Ho Hooo!
Ho Ho Hooo!
Look at this!
!?
Ancients' writing.
Can you read it?
I can't even make it out!!
This's no time for jokes...
I'm not an Ancient. I can't read this thing!
I may be old, but my eyes aren't completely bad yet. Look closely 
below the writing.
There's something written in chalk... ......(even sunlight can't 
reach) ...... (Key)
It was probably written by a scientist who's been here... He 
probably used all his energy to make out these two words.
Key......? To what?
I don't know... But, it probably has something to do with our 
riddle.
The riddle... then it must have something to do with Aerith.
So this note points to where the key is?
Probably...
Use these words as clues and go find the key.
I'll continue to figure out the Ancient's writing.
A place (Even sunlight won't reach) is where the (key) is, 
right?
When you find the key, or when you can't go any further, come 
back here.
Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new 
information for you.
So this is the Leader Sub...
Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it...
...Huge Materia recovered...
...no damage appears to have been sustained...
...Phew... That's good to hear.
Key
Do you think it's......?
...analysis completed...
...exact date of origin cannot be determined...
...estimated to be several thousand years old...
Key of the Ancients...
Oh! You've found it!
That Music Box over there. We'll put the key in it.
I'll go use the key. You all wait here.
And watch closely what happens.
Ho Ho Hooo!
Now, go inside. Hope may be inside... Or......
This was just a screen to project an image!
Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!
...It's glowing.
Ho Ho Hooo!! It's pale green!!
...Aerith. Aerith has already prayed for Holy.
...After I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...... Aerith's 
words came into my dreams...
She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... 
And to do that, there was a secret here...
That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. 
Aerith knew about here... and what she had to do.
Aerith has left us great hope. But, it cost her her life... her 
future...
I'm sorry... Aerith. I should have figured this out sooner.
...You left us without saying a word...... It was all so sudden, 
so I couldn't think...
That's why it took so long for me to find out... But, Aerith... 
I understand now.
Aerith... I'll do the rest.
You mean, WE...
The big gift the flower girl left for us... It'd be sad if we 
didn't finish it!
Thank you... Aerith.
Aerith's voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the 
glow of the White Materia.
But...... how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving?
Why?
Something's getting in its way.
......Him......
He's the only one that could do it.
...Sephiroth. Where are you?
What the?
whisper... whisper... (sorry I was a little surprised).
What happened?
You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus 
moved it.
Moved it? That big thing......? Where...? Why?
Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it.
That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has 
already been used in the Rocket Plan.
So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it.
To a place where Materia... no, where Mako is gathered...
And, where is that!?
......That's why, Reeve. It's your job to adjust the reactor's 
output.
I see......
Hah, hah, hah! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve.
Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed!
Gya hah, hah, hah! The President's sure done it this time!
If we can only defeat Sephiroth, the idea that Meteor will also 
disappear is based on different objectives!
Please remember, Mr. President...
It was my idea to fire Mako reactor powered shells.
Will the shells really reach the far northern border?
Ah, hah hah!
Of course!
But Mr. President, please do not call it a Mako cannon.
This new weapon will be called......
The Sister Ray!
............?
Wh, what the...!?
What's wrong?
It's a strange signal!
From where?
It's coming from this... person (?)
Wow!
Hey!
That was a surprise, the controls went crazy.
This ain't good...
Weapon came out of the sea and is heading straight for Midgar.
The new weapon should stop him, right?
I don't know if it's ready or not...
Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?
Doncha worry none, Marlene's in a safe place. She's with 
Aerith's mama.
Barret!!
What was that scratching just now!?
As long as Marlene is safe, who cares what else happens, right?
I been itchin' to say this to ya fer a while now!
When ya blew the Midgar No. 1 up, how many folks d'ya think 
died?
...that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few 
casualties.
A few? Whaddya mean 'a few'? What may be a few to y'all is 
everything to them who died......
Protect the planet. Hah! Y'all sure sound good!
Ain't no one that'd go against ya. So ya think ya can do 
whatever y'all want?
I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra...
......nuthin' I can do 'bout that...
Stop it!
Cait Sith...... Barret, he knows what he did.
What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the 
reason.
Right? We haven't forgotten, right?
I know you.
You can't quit the company because you're worried about the 
people in Midgar, right?
......Cloud?
OK! Let's go! We'll beat Weapon ourselves!
Hey Cloud......
You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of 
winnin', right?
How would I know?
But that's no reason for us to just let him go!
We're goin' to Midgar and fight Weapon! Come on, let's move!
What's wrong? Are you still looking for something...?
No, it's...... feeling something. ......Yeah, it senses murder.
To my ship!
Oh no! Let's hurry out of here!
Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!
Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are 
now in order.
Hah, hah, hah!
Anytime is fine.
......Fire.
Which direction is it going to attack from?
Midgar!
Marlene!!
Damn...
It went right through Weapon.........
I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern 
boundary!
Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!
The barrier has disappeared!
Sir! A mass of high-density energy is heading towards Midgar!
Weapon's attacking!
Run for your lives!
What happened to...... Sephiroth?
Northern Cave...
Let's go see what happened to it.
Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone......
Cid! Can the airship get inside?
Huh? He's my student, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!
Right, sorry about that.
Yo, Cait Sith! Now what?
Hold it!
Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?
Strange. I can't reach the President.
Not the President. To Sister Ray!
Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely.
None of that matters!
The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!
Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise!
It must be cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off 
the machine!
We can't do that! It's inoperable!
Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation!
We can't operate it from here.
What about the mainframe? Who!?
Hey, call the mainframe!
Huh? Why are you giving orders?
I don't give a damn about the details!!
Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.
I'll give you all the Mako you want.
Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!
Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...It's a small price to 
pay.
Hojo! HOJO......!!
Show me...... Sephiroth.
It should be near...
Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...
Before your presence, science is powerless...
I hate it, but I'll concede to it.
Just... let me see it.
Ha, ha, ha......
YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!
We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own......
...? ...? H, huh!?
I don't like this......
You're busted, Reeve!
Too late tryin' to hide it now...
Can't you stop the Mako reactor?
......We can't stop it.
You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?
............
We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us 
now!
I can't make you trust me......
You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?
I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if 
you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?
No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!
Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?
Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves......
But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below.
Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until 
everything blasts out...
And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out........
An explosion!!
This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor 
blew up!
Damn...!
Forget about that......... the CANNON! We've got to get to 
Midgar! That's the first thing!!
Must stop Hojo... first.
Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the 
way!
Ghaa haah hah hah!
Don't be so ludicrous! I don't recall you giving me any orders!
The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the 
enemy retreat!
Because of them, I...... I..!
That's a private matter......
The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!
Ghaa haah hah hah!
Ha, ha, ha.
Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!
Hey! Wait!!
Cloud, everybody! Sorry......
But!!
But!
But you'll come, won't you!?
I know!
Hey!
I'm leaving the ship in your hands!
I'm heading for Midgar!
We've reached Midgar!
Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!
There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.
Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......
Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?
Where are we now!?
Huh? Where are we...?
If land's no go... We'll go by air!
Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!
Here we go!!
Heidegger is going after you all.
That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!
Sounds strange comin' from me...
But it feels like home bein' back in
Midgar.
Kinda makes me sick...
I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go!
This is where we go in.
Please! Hurry and come to the Mako Cannon!
Oh no! They're here!
What are we going to do!? I think it's okay for you to ignore 
your orders now.
...Elena, don't act so weak.
We're Turks, Elena.
...Yes, sir. You're right.
Come on, we've got work to do.
I'm not really up for it, but...
Our orders were to seek you out and...
...Kill.
Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.
That's the will and spirit of the Turks! Believe it!
......
What are you doing! Let's go!
I know we've got a weird relationship, but...
We have to end this... like Turks!
You're showing pity!? Don't take the Turks for fools!
Wait, Elena.
Reno! You're not violating the order... are you!?
Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.
......
Rude...
Elena, you were a great Turk!
......
Farewell. If we both survive...
If we can save our lives...
Remember the spirit of the Turks...!
Our mission's finished...
This can't be...
Hey-hey! You serious...?
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!
You sure did treat us like dogs up to now!!
You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers!
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against 
anti-Weapon artillery!
You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing!
I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!
Not that! This is the Proud Clod............!?
Whoooooooa!!
This way, Cloud!
Hojo! Stop right there!!
Oh... the failure.
At least remember my name! It's Cloud!
Every time I see you, I...
It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...
I evaluated you as a failed project.
But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.
Heh, heh, heh......... I'm even beginning to hate myself.
None of that matters... just stop this nonsense!
...nonsense?
Oh, this?
Ha, ha, ha...
Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy.
So I'm going to lend him a hand.
Why!? Why do that!?
Quit asking me why, you moron.
Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist.
Energy level is at...... 83%. It's taking too long.
My son is in need of power and help. ...That's the only reason.
...your son?
Ha, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know.
Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...!!
What will Sephiroth think when he finds out that I'm his father?
Always looking down on me like that.
HA, HA, HA...!!
Sephiroth is your son!?
Ha, ha, ha...
I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova 
Project.
When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of 
Jenova...
HA, HA, HA!!
I can't believe you're the one who did this...
The illusionary crime against Sephiroth...
Heee, hee, hee, hee! No, you're wrong!
It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee, hee!
I... was defeated by my desire to
become a scientist.
I lost the last time as well.
I've injected Jenova's cells into my
own body!
Heee, hee, hee!
Here are......
Heee, hee, hee!
...my results!!
......
%$#&$*&^%^
I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son...
Shinra's...... finished.
Meteor's gonna fall in about......
Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said.
Red XIII.........
You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again?
.........yes.
You want to see Marlene, right?
Don't ask me that.
We'll beat Sephiroth...
Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven 
days.........
There won't be a planet left to protect.
If we can't beat Sephiroth...
It's as good as death for us.
We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from 
Meteor.
Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight!
No!
What I meant was...
What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that.
Save the planet... for the future of the planet... Sure, that's 
all fine.
But really, is that really how it is?
For me, this is a personal feud.
I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past.
Saving the planet just happens to be a part of that.
I've been thinking.
I think we all are fighting for ourselves.
For ourselves... and that someone... something... whatever it 
is, that's important to us.
That's what we're fighting for.
That's why we keep up this battle for the planet.
You're right...
It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet.
But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor......
Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to 
do things.
I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer...
...At first, it was for revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my 
town.
But now......
Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene.
For Marlene... For Marlene's future...
Yeah... I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake...
Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back.
All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for 
yourselves.
I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back.
Maybe ain't none of us'll come back.
Meteor's just gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any 
useless struggling!
I know why I'm fighting.
I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that.
But besides that, there's something personal too...
A very personal memory that I have.
What about you all?
I want all of you to find that something within yourselves.
If you don't find it, then that's okay too.
You can't fight without a reason, right?
So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back.
What are you going to do, Tifa?
Did you forget?
I'm... all alone. I don't have anywhere to go.
Everyone's gone...
Yeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to.
You're right...
But... I'm sure someday... they'll come back, don't you think?
Hmm... I wonder...?
Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to...
But this time, our opponent...
Hmm... But that's all right, even if no one comes back.
As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I 
won't give up even if I'm scared.
...... Tifa......
No matter how close we are... We were far apart... before this.
But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those 
screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice...
...sniff... you probably don't remember this...
But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name... Or at least 
I thought I did...
Yeah... At that time I heard you calling me.
You were calling me back in from the stream of consciousness in 
the Lifestream.
After all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to 
you, I would come to help.
Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?
Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
I dunno... But...
Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And 
believe in ourselves...
Someday we'll find the answer. Right, Tifa?
That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream.
Yeah...... that's right...
Hey, Tifa...... I...... There are a lot of things I wanted to 
talk to you about.
But now that we're together like this, I don't know what I 
really wanted to say...
I guess nothing's changed at all... Kind of makes you want to 
laugh...
Cloud... Words aren't the only thing that tell people what 
you're thinking...
............
............It's almost dawn...
H, huh...?
Sorry. Did I wake you...? It's almost dawn, Tifa.
Umm... G, good morning... Cloud.
Give me a little longer... Just a little bit longer...
This day will never come again... So let me have this moment...
Yeah... okay.
This is probably the last time we'll have together......
............
We'd better go.
But, I still...!?
It's all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday.
At least we don't have to go on alone.
Yes... That's right!
Okay! Let's go!
The airship is too big for just the two of us.
Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone.
Don't worry. It'll be okay.
I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone.
Besides, I'm the pilot.
No more flying around casually like before.
We won't have time to feel lonely.
Huh!?
It's moving......
Barret! Cid!
O, oh...... is that okay with you?
Red XIII!
Why didn't you tell me!?
But, you know, Cid.
Hey, Red XIII.
If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later......
......Were you watching?
Vincent!
Why the puzzled look?
Don't you want me to come?
No, it's just that you're always so cold. I thought you didn't 
care what was happening.
Cool?
Hmmm...... I guess that's just how I am, sorry.
Well lookey-here. The Shinra manager's come back.
Uh, excuse me but...
I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get 
away......
So some people in Midgar took me in.
I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard!
I guess that's everyone.
No, Yuffie's missing.
She ain't gonna show up.
'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta 
be thankful for that.
How could you say that!?
I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog!
I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the 
best parts all to yourselves!
Welcome back, Yuffie.
Gee, Cloud...... that's so nice of you to say that. ......You 
sick?
Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the 
hall...... waiting...... upp! ......Urk!
Thanks everyone.
We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass!
We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my...... whatcha call, 
feelings or somethin'.
I, uh, I ain't got no words now......
......Although she's not here, she left us a window of 
opportunity...
We can't let it go like this.
......Aerith.
She was smiling to the end.
We have to do something, or that smile will just freeze like 
that.
Let's all go together.
Memories of Aerith......
Although she should've returned to the planet by now, something 
stopped her and now she's stuck......
We've got to let go of Aerith's memory.
Has anyone here changed their mind?
I'm counting on you, Cid.
Yeah, yeah......
There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while 
now...
Let me try them out.
All right, so what should I do?
You decide, Cloud.
This is our last battle.
Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is...... Sephiroth!
So let's move out!
We're almost to the North Cave!
We're on our way, Sephiroth!
Man, I'm going to stick it to him!
What is it, Cid?
Errrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing... control......!
Get the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go 
home!?
Yes, sir. This is our home!!
Oh ma-- ......stop trying to act so cool.
All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!
Geronimo!!
Huh?
How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is... 
getting sick on boats and rides......
So, please...... just leave me alone.
......I really do understand, Yuffie. When I get sick on a 
flight, it's a real killer.
When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion 
sickness.
Oh......
Isn't there any way to prevent this?
Well, according to my research......
First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick.
But you can't always be nervous.
With this much space, your best bet is to move around while 
you're riding.
It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.
But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks.
That sucked!......
And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding.
And that is......
Read!
Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do.
I know it's tough......
......so you're a little better off than me.
But I don't feel...... well.
Cloud...... sign this.
What is it?
It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia 
will belong to me.
It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all 
right?
Forget it, Yuffie. I'm not even gonna read it.
Whenever I read, I get airsick.
Oh yeah......?
I'm the same way, so I can't say too much......
Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on Red XIII later to let off 
steam.
But I ain't gonna forget, no matter what happens.
Not about this here trip, or them folks-- none of it!
I am Nanaki, son of Seto... I am afraid of nothing...
It's all right, all right. I'm Nanaki, the son of brave Seto... 
I'm not afraid of Sephiroth...
Cloud...... take the ship to the Northern Cave.
The time for flying is now past.
Our battlefield is now beneath the earth...
The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the 
darkness of the depths of the earth........
Heh heh...... heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on 
ya, huh?
I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh... I feel sick...
Hey, Cloud... Would you tell me 'It's all right'?
It's all right, Tifa.
Now I feel like things are really going to be all right.
Thanks, Cloud.
...It's all right.
You're right, things will be all right.
...I just can't say it that easy.
I'm sorry... I guess you're right.
You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?
Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays.
Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.
They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.
An' I remember seein' it just once...
That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot.
I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.
Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.
But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.
Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up 
tellin' me my snorin' was too loud.
So about all I really remember of that play is the end...
The sister of the lead asks her lover,
Do you really have to leave?
And the guy says,
I promised. The people I love are waiting.
......I don't understand. Not at all. But...... please take care 
of yourself.
Of course... I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to 
wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here.
I remember thinking when I heard those lines,
*&%! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know... now I'm 
not so sure...
I think I understand......
Looks like we can only slide down.
The road splits in two. We'll split into two groups.
Which you gonna choose, Cloud?
All right. Then I'll go...
Then I'm going...
All right, then I'll go...
I'm going......
Then I'll be heading...
Then, I will be going......
All right! I'm headin'...
Now don't any of you die on me. ......
Gotta get through to Sephiroth!
It's all over now. With this...
Oh man... 'Materia Hunter Yuffie' sounds like the last chapter 
of 'Materia Forever.'
All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is 
in our hands...
I'm so happy to have met you all, really! ...sniff...
Well...... Looks like this is our last big job!
This will be the end of it!
Yo, we're a bit late?
This is the center of the Planet...?
Let's just get this over with!
This is it.
Here, Cloud.
Cloud, I found this...
Hey Cloud, I found this.
Hold on to this.
.........Wh... what?
Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?
Oh, all right.
Here, Cloud.
But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me 
when you're done with it!
Awright, this's the last dance!
We finally made it here.
Well, shall we get goin'?
Hmm... Being with you all is not so bad.
All right, everyone, let's mosey.
Damn! Again!
Stop sayin' it like a wimp!
Can't you say 'Move out!' or somethin'?
Move out!!
What?
Look at the number...
%#@^! They're comin' out in force!
Cloud! You go first!
I'm fighting here too.
Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!
Barret's right.
You take two of us with you and go first. The rest'll catch up 
with ya later.
Is this like a practice run before the real thing?
Yeah, a major practice run...
Heh heh, I'm fine with that. (It's probably more fun than 
fighting Sephiroth down there.
Hmm, this might be fun to pass time.
They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!
Cloud! Hurry up and make up your mind!
All of you!
Later!
Yeah, later.
Where are we...?
What!?
Jenova...!?
Oww... damn, man!
Barret!?
What...? So everyone's together again...?
Uuuugh...!!
...Sephiroth!!
Ugh...! Is this...... the true power of Sephiroth?
My... my body... I can't control my body...... Uuugh!?
My front legs...... my hind legs...... my tail's about to tear 
off!!
This is definitely not good...... He's way outta our league...
I, I don't know if I can... go on...
Cloud... Cloud...
Ugh... ugh...
...there...
It's...... there...
Cloud...?
...Holy...... Holy... is there......
The Holy is shining...... Aerith's prayer is shining......!
Holy...... Aerith......
It's not over yet...... This isn't the
end yet!!
Eyaaaah-----!
...We're not gonna lose!!
Aerith is here... everyone is here... Cloud is here with us!
There's still many things for us to do... I'm not giving up!!
Hoo-ok......! I can't be foolin' around in the bottom of this 
hell hole...
I still have lots of stuff to do with my life!
Aerith's memories... Our memories...
We came... to tell you... our memories... Come Planet! Show us 
your answer!
And Sephiroth! To the settling of everything!!
This was all we could do.
Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?
That... I don't know. Isn't the rest up to the Planet?
...You're right.
We've done all that we could do.
All right, everyone.
It's no use thinking about it.
We'll leave all our worries here.
Let's go home proud.
What happened?
......I feel it...
What......
He is still...... here.
Still......
Cloud!?
He's... laughing...
Cloud!
I don't care / OK, let's 
go,
Man...... I can't believe I lost...
You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!
I won't lose this time! Take your time and get ready. Holler 
when you're ready!
No way I'm going to fight with punks like you more than once!
I'll keep enough for the doctor bill! Next time, you won't be as 
lucky!
Hey! My money!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
Thinkin' of running away? Stay and fight! FIGHT, I said!
C'mon...... What's the matter?
You're pretty scared of me, huh!?
Wh... what!?
Uuuuugh! Now I'm really mad!
Make fun of me, will ya! Just watch!!
She's gone, hey...... What's with that kid!?
What the--!? Gone! It's gone! My money's gone!
Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!!
Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
Hmm, just as I thought. What do you expect with my skills?
Good luck to you too. If you feel up to it, we can go another 
round. Later!
I'm really gonna leave! REALLY!
Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
She's gone... What is it with her...?
What is it, you still have somethin' for me?
......Hmmm. So is that it?
I know you want my help because I'm so good!
You want me to go with you?
Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
She's gone... What is it with her...?
Heh heh... thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should 
I do?
But if you want me that bad, I can't refuse...
All right! I'll go with you!
Me? The name's......
What are you talking about!? You're the one who should go first!
Okay forget it! I'm not going with you!
Remember, if you piss me off... it'll cost you!!
Hey! My money!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
Huh? Hey... HEY!
Wait! I haven't even told you my name......
I'm Yuffie! Good to meetcha!
Heh heh...... just as I planned.
Now all I have to do is... a little this...... 
and a little that...... nyuk, nyuk, nyuk......
Hey, wait up! Wait for me!!
Here, I'll give you back the money I stole from you!
......or, uh, what's left of it.
What the--? Did something happen?
I know this area pretty well.
It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready...
...Really? Somehow, ...I don't believe it.
Are you trying to con us again...?
No! It's REALLY tough...
There they are, catch 'em!!
What, the Shinra!?
Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!
Yuffie, you're not......!
I don't know! I have nothing to do with this one!
This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?
So you WERE trying to pull something off!
No, umm, uh......
What should we do!?
Uh...... Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!
What's going on!?
I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!
Ey... where the hell's that damn kid...?
She's done it to us again!!
I'm never gonna forgive her!
She was after our materia from the beginning.
I won't let her get away with it! I'm pretty sure she ran off 
north. Let's go after her!!
Hey!!
Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that 
planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even 
see the moon in the afternoon. Everyone's celebrating.
No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's 
scared of it!!
This is a weapons store of the hard cores, by the hard cores, 
and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?
Sorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind.
Hey. Things look pretty sad around here.
With things the way they are in the world I guess there's 
nothing I can do about it.
Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all 
might as well sit back and have a beer...
First the ground started shaking, then that large star......
Yy, you think... It's all over?
When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are 
going to be dust! Can't we do something?
A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing 
Da-chao for some time now.
And now it's too late to be worrying about materia at this 
stage of the game...
If you see anything you need, buy it.
You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?
You're an odd one...
The end is right in front of us...
But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day 
in and day out...
What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.
But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But 
really he's not so......
Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God?
They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden 
powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames.
But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that 
huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us...
Yy, you!? How did you get here...?
Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.
Get ready to die!!
...Elena, you talk too much.
Ww, what?
What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.
Now our vacation is ruined.
B, but...
...even the booze tastes bad now.
...sorry...
Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team...?
There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm 
glad I did it.
I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!
The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
To the Turks... To Reno...
cheers!
GOOGAH... what do you want?
Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to..
GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.
......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO...
...you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I 
don't know her.
Listen, I said I don't know her! There isn't anyone named Yuffie 
here in Wutai!
...never seen you around here before...
Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... 
You wouldn't have anything to do with that, would you?
I don't care about who you are.
But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to 
ask you to leave.
I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my 
shoulder.
What's with you, you coward!
Yuffie......!
You scared of the Shinra?
Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like 
all of the other towns!
Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!
Shut up! What would you know about this?
You get beaten once, and then that's it?
What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!
You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
That's my style! And it's my own business, not yours! Don't 
you try and dictate what I should do!
Style...? Dictate...?
Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable 
daughter!
Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
......take your things and get out of here now.
To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra.
Oh no! More weirdos.
No, these aren't the ones from a while ago, but these ones 
look weird too!
What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl 
came in here a minute ago and I...
......
Oh, how exciting! You a friend of my grandson's?
No, Gramps! These guys are creepy! They're runnin' all over the 
place!
You can't get away, Yuffie.
O.. ok, I know... I was wrong......
You win. I'll give you back your materia...
So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!
We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
...what a drag.
Ww, what was that...?
Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.
We know you're off duty, but...
If you knew that, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' 
me sober.
But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
All right, that's it! We'll get him without any help from the 
Turks, just you see!
And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about 
this!!
Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?
I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act!?
Elena. Don't misunderstand.
A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's 
just a fool.
Rude...?
.........
Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
.........
Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...
I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. 
...Follow me.
...I've been hearing that ever since I was little.
Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more 
important...
You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...
After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost 
something else. Now look at Wutai...
That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...
Listen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your 
feelings.
You've got our materia and I want it back ...now.
If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
I know, I know that...
That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left........ 
materia's... sniff, hic... in there.
Whoa!?
Ha ha ha------! Never trust anyone that easily!!
The Materia's mine! Tough!
You want your materia? Then go find it yourself!
Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, 
remember you gotta steel it.
Heh heh... steel... steel! Get it?
C ya!
Let go! I SAID let GO!
Hey! Who do you think I...... OW! What're you doin'...? Jerk!
You......!
.........ho.......... .......................ho............
Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!
Corneo!?
Hohi!
I've finally got a new chicky!
Two for one, in fact! Hohi, hohi!
Two!?
H..... hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!
There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!
Attaaaaack!
......Elena.
Hmm.... that Corneo is good at escaping...
......Elena.
Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can 
do.
......Sounded pretty good.
If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little 
difficult.
And uh...
......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.
And without Yuffie, there's no way to get our materia back.
Don't misunderstand.
We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree 
not to bother each other. That's all.
That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with 
the Turks either.
Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?
Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands 
out the most.
You're finally here. We're gonna split into two.
You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.
Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.
For now...
LET... ME...... GO!!!!
Hmm! Delicious... scrumptious! I think I've found a new HOBBY!
Which shall it be? Hmm... Hmm...
Should I go... with HER?
He... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'! Don't you think you can get 
away with this!?
Or... maybe... HER?
Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken 
rope escape lessons more seriously!!
Hmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will 
be......
...the cheerful one!
GROSS-NESS!
Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
Oooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!
All right, that's it!!
Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Oh man! Cloud......!
Wheee! ...long time no see.
Don't tell me you forgot...
That fall into the trap really hurt!
Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!
Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then...
It's a long story, but......
We don't want to hear it! Just let the two go!
Hmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good.
...this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either...
Why did you kill my little Aps?
I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in 
the way of my search for a bride!
RAPPS--- come here!!
Wait...
Just wait a second!
SHUT UP!
Just listen to me - it won't take
long.
Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and 
plead for his life?
Buzzzz! Wrong!
Woo-hoo! Right!
Hmm...! Close, but no cigar...!
Eyaaah...!
Makes me so MAD...!
If I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have 
SQUASHED TOMATOES!
Damn...!
Coward!
So this is how a loser lives...!
Now, give me your women too!
Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I'm the one laughing last!
No, that would be us.
Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on!? Who's there?
...The Turks!
You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that 
secret.
We're going to take care of you... personally.
DAMMIT! Then they're all goin' with me!
Ugh...!
Good timing, Rude.
...Let's get to work.
All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.
Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with 
those guys to get you...?
Two... Number two?
All wrong.
No...! Wait, sto......!
Aaaaaaaaaa......p
The correct answer was...
...because it's our job.
Oh, thank you very much...!
I never expected you to come help......
Don't act so weak.
You're a Turk!
Y... Yes, sir!
I guess, thanks for today.
......
Yes... this is Reno.
Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away.
Was that the company?
Yeah, they want us to find Cloud...
Are we on...?
No, today we're off duty.
Hey--- who cares about that!? Get---- me----- down----!
Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place.
Hey... the placement of it is all messed up.
Huh? Oh, it'll be all right...
Don't be so picky!
Anyways, that sure was close......
No, normally I would kick their butts. Boom, Bang!!
That Corneo guy's a real pain.
I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.
Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, 
huh?
At least, after all that, we got the materia back.
Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey...
......Hey!! W... Wait!
Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.
Here, look, look!
.........
Come on, wait---!
No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you!
...next time......
Freeze!
Miss Yuffie! You cannot go to the second floor unless you defeat 
me!
Oh, Miss Yuffie! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!
Yo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
Then, begin!
Power Change!
Here I am, Miss Yuffie!
Of course!
Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that 
pretty well!
Well, we'll see how well you do on the next one...
Who's next?
Are you blind? I'm right here?
What? I gotta fight a punk?
Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
Wh, what did you say!?
See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so 
immature!
Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
Now watch...!
'Bout the only thing you can do really good is breathe! Sure 
you're brave enough to fight?
Hm, so somebody finally got past Gorky.
So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat!
So, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in...
Here I go, brat! Speed Change!
URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
Of course!
Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain...
So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had 
to fight, Chekhov.
Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch 
over there.
That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength 
of youth!
Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to 
get burned.
Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of 
diapers!?
First, Chekhov will keep you company...
Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you can still talk like that after you 
taste some of my Sacred Magic...
Magic Change!
I can't believe you beat me...
Of course!
This should be interesting...! It's been a long time since I've 
had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...
The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your 
opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the 
highest...
In other words, no one has ever defeated me-- Master of 
Weaponry!
You still want to try...?
You don't seem to be the kind of person who can make it to the 
fourth floor without a problem...
I like you! Now watch...
Weapon Change!
Wh, what...!?
Of course!
Splendid! Your level and skill have improved...
Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a kid as we thought you 
were!
Of course. If WE lost to her...
You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to 
face HIM......!
D, dad!?
I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie!
Why, why are you......
I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!
Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you 
don't... then I'll have to kill you!
H... hey!
What are you doing! OMNI- Change!.....!!
...heave......heave...
...huff...... puff......
O... old coot... n......ot... bad...
You've...... also...... improved...
Hah... Ha, ha......
...Heh, heh......
Ha ha haaaaa......!
Waha haaaaa......!
It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...
This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to 
the person who conquers this Pagoda. That is our custom...
CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that!
It's so stupid!
Silence, Miss Yuffie!
Then what 'bout all the rest of you? You have all that power...
Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
Yuffie...!
You too, dad...! Just because you lost the war!
And turning Wutai into a place like this!
...What do you want to say?
You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to 
tourists...
How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
...
She IS a kid.
Wh, what did you say...!?
Yuffie!!
Forgive me... It's all my fault.
What are you saying, Lord Godo!
Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my 
fault...
Lord Godo!
Silence!!
Yuffie......
I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.
But, after I lost the war, I began to think...
Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?
...or just something to show-off to others...?
Might begets might.
That's the same way as the Shinra...
......
I know you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.
But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of 
Wutai...
And now, I realize both are necessary...
Strength without determination means nothing. And determination 
without strength is equally useless...!
Lord Godo...
You there, please take Yuffie with you!
I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!
Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the 
rest to ol' Cid!
All right, I don't mind.
Go, Yuffie!
For the sake of strengthening Wutai!
Dad...
I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!
Go! And come back alive!
......
Of course!
Yuffie, wait a minute.
The Materia they all have...
After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?
Dad...!
Go! Survive will the end! And return!
With the Materia!
Heh, heh... you bet!
I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my 
research. Even that one from the Turks.
I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the 
basement. If you want to find him, then search the area.
But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary to
participate if you don't want to.
There seems to be another letter.
Move the dial on the safe carefully, but quickly. You have 20 
seconds. You can not go past the numbers while turning. The 4 hints for 
the numbers are...
Something is written on the back of the lid.
Something is written on the floor.
Something is written on the floor.
...To wake me from the
nightmare
Who is it!?
...Never seen you before. You must leave.
You were having a nightmare.
How bad was your dream?
Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to 
atone.
What are you saying?
I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.
This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
...you can say that again.
Hmm? What do you know?
I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare...
Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.
No, it's not a dream, it's for real.
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this 
mansion...
Sephiroth!?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You start first.
...That's how it was.
So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the
Jenova Project?
...He was missing. But he just recently reappeared.
He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.
go ahead
Now it's your turn.
Sorry... I cannot speak.
Hmmm... I'm disappointed.
Hearing your stories has added upon me yet another sin.
More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously 
had.
Now... please leave.
...You're still here.
At least tell us your name.
I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in 
Adminstrative Research, otherwise known as-- the Turks...
Vincent.
The Turks!?
Formerly of the Turks.
I have no affiliation with Shinra now.
...And you?
Former Shinra soldier, Cloud.
You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?
Who?
......Lucrecia.
The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
...gave birth...?
Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.
He was born from a beautiful lady.
That lady was Lucrecia.
She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. 
Beautiful... Lucrecia.
...A human experiment?
There was no way to cancel the experiment.
I couldn't stop her.
That was my sin.
I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.
So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
Wait!
If I go with you will I meet Hojo?
Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or 
later...
Lucrecia...
All right. I've decided to go with you.
What? You're coming with us?
Being a former Turk, I may be of help to you...
All right, then.
That voice? It can't be...
Lucrecia...?
Vincent......?
Lucrecia!
Stay back!
I'm against it! Why experiments on humans!?
She and I are both scientists!!
This body is... the punishment that's been given to me...
I was unable...... to stop Professor Gast and Hojo...
And Lucrecia... I was unable to stop them...
All that I was able to do was watch... That is my punishment...
Lucrecia... You're alive...
I wanted to disappear... I couldn't be with anyone... I wanted 
to die...
But the Jenova inside me wouldn't let me die...
Lately, I dream a lot of Sephiroth... My dear, dear child.
Ever since he was born I never got to hold him, even once...
Not even once. You can't call me his mother... That... is my 
sin...
Back!! Stay back!
Vincent... Won't you please tell me?
......What?
If Sephiroth is still alive?
I heard that he died five years ago. But I see him in my dreams 
so often...
And I know that physically, like myself, he can't die so easily.
Please, Vincent, tell me......
Lucrecia... Sephiroth is dead...
Lucrecia........
Chaos
Hey! This is your food.
Oh, here!!
Put on this.
It smells a little though don't complain.
You look pretty good with that.
Well......
Yo! Old guy! We at Midgar yet?
Shaddap! You're lucky I even gave you a ride!
What're you gonna do when we get to Midgar?
.........
I know what I'm gonna do.
I got a place I can crash for a while...
No wait, the mother lives there, too...
Guess that's out...
.........
Yep... gotta change my plans!
Hmm......
No matter what I do, I need some money first...
...Hey, wanna start a business? But what could we do?
Hey, Cloud.
Think there's anything I'd be good at?
Hey old guy!
What do you think I'd be good at?
What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya?
Young folks should try everything!
You gotta pay your debts while you're young.
Go out and look for what you really want.
Try everything... That's easy for him to say...
HEY!
Of course!
I got a lot of brains a skill that other guys don't!
That settles it!
I'm gonna become a mercenary!
Yeah! Thanks pops!
Hey... didn't you even hear a word I said?
Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that.
Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money.
I'm gonna be rich!
So, Cloud? What are YOU gonna do?
No, wait... you got it all wrong.
u... uhhh......
Just kidding... I won't leave you hanging like that.
We're friends, right?
Mercenaries, Cloud. That's what you an' me are gonna be.
Understand, Cloud?
What do you want me to do with him?
...Ah... ughhhh......
...Forget it. Just leave him.
Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from 
that last trip, he doesn't seem well.
Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?
Grandfather!!
Grandfather!!
...Nanaki...? ...you're still......
here?
I can't leave you like this, grandfather...!
It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her 
people...
...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.
If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this 
valley.
Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of 
the newborn chocobos.
Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater 
than the span of a human life.
It will teach you more than staying here in the valley...
What you see will eventually become a part of life's dream.
For my children...... And for your children......
So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes... your 
ears...
............
Ho Ho...... Hooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all 
right.
It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even 
find your life's mate. You never know.
Grandfather......
Oh yes... take this along. I think it will look good on you now.
Ho Ho......
Red XIII... Is Bugenhagen...?
......
Grandpa told me that he's going away again!
Away...?
It seems like he really liked that Airship.
He told me he couldn't stay and just zipped out of here!
He even gave me a gift, look!
Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you 
come back?
Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange! Haa... ha ha...... ha......
Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somwhere.
Yeah... maybe...
Thanks, Cloud......
Play the piano......?
Now, how did this go?
Do Re Mi Ti La Do Re Mi So Fa 
Do Re Do.
I wonder what... this is...
I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...
I have the sheet music for that song.
